Bring a Pheromone

Interactivity Description  
Are pheromones the secret to lasting love and connection? Or, do you just want an excuse to smell a stranger's armpit? Not Sure? Just Bring a Pheromone\!

We're bringing pheromone awareness (and romance) back to the playa\!

Bring a Pheromone is an interactive booth for your armpits, your smelling bits, and your biggest sex organ \- your brain \- available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\! The carnivalesque facade and the three iconic pit (glory)holes tempt passersby to try their hand (er, nose) at smelling out their friends/lovers or just having the novel opportunity to dig in (not too hard) to the surprisingly rich experience of analyzing an armpit from top to bottom, side to side, inside and out. 

During Pheromone Happy Hour held every other afternoon, our Scent Sommeliers take the enterprising wanderers through a proper armpit smelling:

Name the armpit using a Rorschach-type analysis of the available armpit features (with names ranging from 'Old Man Whiskers' to '5pm Shadow' to 'Glitterpit').  
Sample the moisture level with the tip of the finger.  
Take an initial whiff, preferably with nostril-to-pit contact, of the overall scent and give it a general rating.  
Delve into each of the important characteristics of the smell (nuttiness, robustness, acidity, sweetness, earthiness, and so on) and plot points on a "flavor profile" graph that acts as a beautiful visualization of a pit.  
Rate the attractiveness of the scent.  
Before concluding, the smeller might even be encouraged to go in for a taste and will have an opportunity to meet the pit they sniffed if the desire is mutual.

This data is lovingly recorded by hand on a scent slip and the smeller can either keep it, give it to the smellee, or leave it with Bring a Pheromone.

But Pheromone Happy Hour isn't just for simple smellings, oh no. It's also for Pheromone Tinder, Pits or Balls, and Sniff Out Yer Mate. In 2016, Pits or Balls and Sniff Out Yer Mate were a huge hit and stopped many a burner to witness the (in)accuracy of our senses.

This year, we will be breaking out Pheromone Tinder into it's own event\! We'll bring lead 'em by the nose to love and happieness\>

In addition, as a 24 hour service, it is available to tease passersby into experiencing a Wine & Cheese type analysis of an unseen stranger in the booth (we call it an armpit glory-hole, really).  We've found that manned or unmanned, the booth draws a crowd, preceded by delighted laughter and "oh my god, armpit smelling booth???" 

In addition to our booth, we have a Pheromone Education Center \- a chillout space, playa living room, and bar laced with pheromone propaganda. "Your nose knows."

Come for the pheromones, stay for the love\!

The armpit smelling booth has been huge hit\! (as seen in JRS ([http://jackrabbit.burningman.com/t/ViewEmailArchive/t/4879D1D9586C021F/C67FD2F38AC4859C/\#PVA\_2](http://jackrabbit.burningman.com/t/ViewEmailArchive/t/4879D1D9586C021F/C67FD2F38AC4859C/#PVA_2)),

Campers and Interactivity  
We'll have 6 campers, so, as a small camp, everyone has a hand in everything. All camp members are responsible for helping to run our booth, our events as well as setup and tear down. 

Physical Description  
We have the armpit smelling booth, red, white and blue. Draped in county fair finery & LED lit at night.  
We've made significant improvements to our frontage that give us a very cohesive and themed look   
Next to it is our Pheromone Activity center. A shaded, partly enclosed (but still public) small cuddle space. The activity center exposes pheromone facts and art, and provides our dating subjects a chance to interact (and sniff\!) before they explore the playa.  
Behind that, we have a 30' shade structure to house our campers, as well as space for a kitchen dome, a couple of vehicles, a truck with our solar infratructure, water and a small evap pond and shower.

Night Lighting  
We'll have led lighting around the perimeter of the pheromone education center and inside and outside the armpit smelling booth.

Leave No Trace is a cornerstone of the Burning Man ethos and one of our Ten Principles.    
Practice the 5 R's: Rethink what you bring, Reduce trash when packing, Reuse, Recycle, Restore and Respect.,Make a written plan or detailed strategy for Leaving NO Trace. Your LNT crew should be different from your set-up crew.  Hold people accountable within your camp.,Make arrangements to have everything picked up before the last camper departs.  Leaving things behind is MOOP and will affect your standing with the Placement Team.

During Burning Man, our camp will:  
Clean as you go, and never let it hit the ground\!,Adopt the principles and practices of Leave No Trace at Burning Man.,Acculturate all camp members about minimizing our impact on the playa, learn about the Fairy Shrimp and how to protect them too.,Conserve energy, use renewable energy sources and minimize waste.,Collect, reduce and properly dispose of grey and black water. (e.g. we will bring extra buckets to address any leaks.)  Grey and black water is MOOP and of interest to the BLM and the Placement team. Report spills and emergencies immediately.,Use or creatively use discarded materials for all the components of our camp structure and decorations, so that our camp is sustainable year after year.

As we depart the playa, our camp will:  
Bring tools (rakes, magnetic rakes, brooms, MOOP sticks, etc) to clean and pick up every last nail and wood shard that dropped on the playa surface. We will leave our space and our surrounding spaces better than we found them.,Follow the guidelines for line sweeps â€“ performing required multiple sweeps of our camp before leaving BRC. (One sweep is not enough. Do as many passes as necessary: the strength of the line sweep is in the number of people and passes.),Designate a LNT MOOP team within your camp.  They will document all stages of your clean up and remain on playa if you are having any materials picked up.  Anything left unattended in an empty camp is considered MOOP.,Secure all vehicles' loads to prevent windblown trash on the highway and in neighboring communities.
