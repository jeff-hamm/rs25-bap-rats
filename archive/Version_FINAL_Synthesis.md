# Bring a Pheromone - FINAL SYNTHESIS
## Room Service 2025 RAT Submission

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)
**Bring a Pheromone**
*(18 characters)*

---

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)
Our cutting-edge matchmaking algorithm was designed to optimize and monetize attraction. But the microbiome hacked it. Now it only broadcasts pheromone signals between bodies, bypassing The Mind entirely. The system meant to commodify chemistry became a signal station for bodies refusing to be products.

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)
Participants encounter a botanical structure with three circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). The hacked algorithm offers three protocols:

**Self-Serve Broadcasting (2pm-1am daily):** Insert your armpit through one opening while someone samples from the other side. Your microbiome broadcasts to their microbiome without The Mind's interference. Rating cards available. Choose anonymity or revelation.

**Scent Sommelier Certification (staffed sessions):** Learn to read what the algorithm now prioritizes—raw chemical signals. Facilitators guide analysis: name the armpit by visible features, assess moisture, initial scent impression, flavor profile mapping (earthy, nutty, acidic, robust), attractiveness rating, optional taste test. Receive certification and scent documentation proving you can read broadcasts The Mind can't decode.

**Pheromone Matchmaking (staffed):** The algorithm's new protocol: two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden. Both sample each other's broadcasts. Both indicate "signal received" or "frequency mismatch." Compatible? Facilitators reveal identities for a date. Incompatible? Remain anonymous.

Bodies talking to bodies. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving.

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)
The matchmaking algorithm was supposed to be capitalism's triumph: track bodies, optimize attraction, monetize chemistry. The Mind loved it—finally, connection could be rational, controlled, profitable.

Then the microbiome hacked the system. Now it only processes pheromones—chemical broadcasts from gut to nose, from sweat glands to someone else's brain, from microbiome to microbiome. All The Mind's profitable categories collapsed: age, gender, race, conventional attractiveness. The algorithm can't commodify what it can't see.

This is what happens when bodies refuse to be products and insist on communication The Mind can't monitor or monetize. Your pheromones aren't for sale. Your microbiome isn't optimizing for market value. They're just broadcasting your unrepeatable chemical truth to anyone close enough to receive the signal.

We're running the hacked algorithm as a signal station—amplifying conversations your body has been trying to have while The Mind was busy trying to turn you into a commodity. The system designed to control and profit from attraction now just... lets bodies decide.

Bodies talking. Capitalism malfunctioning. The Mind furious. Revolution smells different than expected.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)
This experience explores attraction through scent and involves unconventional body engagement, so consent, safety, and body-positivity are foundational:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains the experience before participation
- Verbal consent required for Matchmaking experiences
- Participants can stop or opt out anytime
- For matching, both parties must consent before identities reveal

**Inclusive Design:**
- Welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities
- No pressure to participate in any specific way—broadcast, receive, or observe
- Self-serve option available without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides structure for those wanting support

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact limited to armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private decompression space available nearby in Art Room
- Contact established with Art Safety team for concerns

**Body Positivity:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity, appreciation, celebration—never judgment
- All scents described using neutral flavor terminology (wine tasting style)
- Experience reframes stigmatized body parts as sites of authentic communication
- No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural broadcasts welcome
- Anti-capitalist framing: bodies as ecosystems with agency, not products to perform or optimize

**If someone struggles, facilitators will:**
1. Immediately check in and offer to pause
2. Provide water and seating
3. Listen without judgment to what's arising
4. Offer Art Safety connection if needed
5. Follow up later to ensure wellbeing

For people whose bodies have been commodified, controlled, or judged by systems claiming to "optimize" them, experiencing attraction outside those metrics can be liberating—and vulnerable. We hold space for both.

### Structure / Room Design
A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth adorned with branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three circular apertures serve as anonymous broadcast/receiving stations—armpit glory holes enabling scent-based communication between participants on opposite sides while remaining visually separated. The organic aesthetic evokes the microbiome's takeover: wild, impossible to commodify, the body's intelligence overtaking The Mind's optimization systems.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with body imagery—aligns with Room Service 2025 style guide
**Symbolism:** The hacked algorithm transformed into living, breathing, broadcasting biology

---

### Placement Preferences
1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Running Elbow Appreciation concurrently in Art Room. Both projects celebrate unconventional body-part-focused connection and bodies refusing to perform as products. Shared crew and scheduling. The vulnerable nature of pheromone broadcasting benefits from a semi-private space where The Mind's surveillance and capitalism's metrics feel less oppressive.

---

### When Active
- Self-serve broadcasting: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed certification/matchmaking: Variable, confirmed Saturday afternoon/evening

## THEMATIC SYNTHESIS

This proposal combines three interconnected concepts:

**1. The Hacked Algorithm (capitalism satirized):**
A matchmaking system designed to commodify attraction got hijacked by the microbiome. What was supposed to optimize and monetize connection now just facilitates body-to-body broadcasting.

**2. Signal Station (bodies communicating):**
Pheromones are how your gut reaches your nose, how sweat glands speak to someone else's brain, how microbiomes broadcast to other microbiomes. We're amplifying signals The Mind can't monitor or control.

**3. Bodies Refusing Commodification:**
Your sweat glands didn't get the capitalism memo. They're not optimizing, not performing, not for sale. They're just broadcasting your unrepeatable chemical truth—and that's revolutionary.

**The unified narrative:** A capitalist technology meant to control bodies became a tool for bodily liberation when the microbiome took over. Now bodies communicate directly, The Mind loses control, and chemistry happens outside the metrics designed to profit from it.

*This version synthesizes all three themes into a cohesive story: the algorithm (capitalism) got hacked by the microbiome (body's intelligence), now it broadcasts pheromone signals (body communication) instead of commodifying attraction (anti-capitalism). Bodies win.*
