# Bring a Pheromone - VERSION A: SIGNAL STATION
## Room Service 2025 RAT Submission

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)
**Bring a Pheromone**
*(18 characters)*

---

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)
Your body parts want to talk to each other but the Mind blocks the signals. Pheromones are how your gut reaches your nose, how sweat glands speak to someone else's brain. We're a signal station amplifying the conversations your body is already having—tuning into frequencies The Mind can't monitor.

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)
Participants discover a botanical structure with circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and surreal body imagery (lips, eyes). Three ways to engage:

**Self-Serve (2pm-1am daily):** Insert your armpit through one opening while someone samples from the other side. Rating cards available for anonymous analysis. Choose to reveal yourself or stay hidden.

**Scent Sommelier Training (staffed sessions):** Facilitators guide wine-tasting-style analysis of an anonymous armpit: name it based on visible features, assess moisture, initial scent impression, flavor profile mapping (nutty, earthy, acidic), attractiveness rating, optional taste test. Participants receive certification and scent documentation slips.

**Pheromone Signal Matching (staffed):** Two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining otherwise hidden. Both sample. Both decide: "signal received" or "frequency mismatch." If chemistry aligns, facilitators reveal identities and send them on a date. If not, they remain anonymous.

All experiences bypass The Mind's categorization systems, letting bodies communicate directly through chemical signals.

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)
The Mind insists on managing all communication—it categorizes bodies, judges attraction, decides who's compatible based on metrics and logic. But your body has been broadcasting signals the whole time: pheromones, microbiome markers, chemical messages that bypass conscious thought entirely.

Bring a Pheromone is a signal station for the body's underground network. When The Mind tries to control who we should find attractive (this gender, that race, this body type), pheromones don't care. They're pre-language, pre-categorization, pre-judgment. They're the Gut reaching past The Mind's blockade to communicate directly with other bodies.

By isolating scent—removing faces, shapes, presentations—we force radical decategorization. All The Mind's labels become useless. What remains is pure chemical conversation, the kind your sweat glands and microbiome have been trying to have all along.

This is embodiment through the body's own communication system. We're not creating connection; we're amplifying the signals that were always there, helping you tune into frequencies The Mind has been jamming.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)
This experience involves unconventional body engagement and exploring attraction through scent alone, so consent, comfort, and boundaries are central:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains what happens before participation
- Verbal consent obtained for Signal Matching experiences
- Participants can stop/opt out anytime
- For matching, both parties must consent before identities reveal

**Inclusive Design:**
- Welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, abilities
- No pressure to participate in any specific way—smell, be smelled, or observe
- Self-serve option available without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides structure for those who want support

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact limited to armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private decompression space available nearby
- Contact established with Art Safety team for any concerns

**Body Positivity:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity and appreciation, never judgment
- All scents described using neutral flavor terminology (like wine tasting)
- Experience reframes stigmatized body parts as sites of connection
- No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural scents welcome
- Focus on bodies as communication systems, not commodities

**If someone struggles, facilitators will:**
1. Immediately pause the experience
2. Provide water and seating in our Art Room
3. Listen without judgment
4. Offer Art Safety connection if needed
5. Follow up later to ensure wellbeing

We approach this as facilitating body-to-body communication while The Mind takes a backseat—which can be vulnerable and powerful.

### Structure / Room Design
A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth structure adorned with branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three circular apertures serve as anonymous armpit glory holes, allowing participants on opposite sides to engage through scent alone while remaining visually separated. The structure is framed by organic elements that evoke the body's internal landscape grown wild—The Mind's tidy categories overtaken by the microbiome's leafy tendrils.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with body imagery—fits Room Service 2025 style guide

---

### Placement Preferences
1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Also running Elbow Appreciation in Art Room. Both projects explore unconventional body-part-focused connection and share crew/scheduling. A semi-private space suits the intimate, vulnerable nature of scent-based exploration.

---

### When Active
- Self-serve: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed sessions: Variable schedule, confirmed for Saturday afternoon/evening

*This version emphasizes bodies communicating around The Mind's attempts at control—a signal station metaphor that fits the microbiome/communication themes of the event narrative.*
