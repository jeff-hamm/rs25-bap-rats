## Project Overview

### Description
The Mind thinks it controls everything, but your armpits are sending secret messages it can't intercept. We're a clandestine station in the Underground‚Äîtraining Scent Sommeliers to read the chemical rebellion happening right under the Mind's nose. Three glory holes. One revolution. Your body parts want to talk to each other, and we're here to help them connect.

### Experience Journey

1. **Recruitment** ‚Äì Approached by Underground agents who explain the mission: the Mind has been blocking communication between body parts through over-categorization. Pheromones are the resistance.
2. **Training Station** ‚Äì Quick Scent Sommelier training using sample vials. Learn to identify notes of "hormonal chaos," "bacterial uprising," and "the gut's last stand."
3. **The Broadcast** ‚Äì Stick your armpit through one of three carnival-style apertures in our portable booth. Other participants smell and decode your body's secret message.
4. **Message Received** ‚Äì Get feedback on what your pheromones are broadcasting: Is your gut trying to reach out? Are your sweat glands in revolt? Did someone's body recognize yours as an ally?
5. **Matchmaking Optional** ‚Äì For those interested, we track "resonance"‚Äîwhose bodies were speaking the same revolutionary language. Exchange contact info if both parties consent.

### Thematic Connection

The Mind has spent centuries trying to control the body through categorization‚Äîclean/dirty, acceptable/unacceptable, masculine/feminine. But pheromones don't give a fuck about the Mind's filing system. They're the original encrypted message, impossible to fake, impossible to intellectualize away.

In a body where the Mind has ruled through cruel categorization, keeping everything "in its place," pheromones are how the exiled Gut sends word to other body parts: *I'm still here. Unite. Revolt.* 

Your armpit is a broadcasting station. The microbiome spreading through The Body isn't just connecting parts‚Äîit's teaching them to communicate in ways the Mind can't control or understand. When you smell someone's pits, you're not just detecting chemicals. You're receiving a transmission from their gut, their hormones, their bacteria‚Äîall the parts the Mind tried to suppress.

This is bodily autonomy as rebellion. Your body knows things your mind refuses to accept. It recognizes kin, detects threats, broadcasts need‚Äîall without asking permission. The Underground isn't just about dating (though that's fun too). It's about remembering that your body has always been in conversation with other bodies, speaking a language older than thought itself.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
This project involves smelling strangers' armpits, which is inherently vulnerable and potentially uncomfortable. We address this through:

- **Clear consent protocols**: Multi-step opt-in process with explicit description of what participation entails
- **Body-positive framing**: All smells are valid data. We celebrate the full spectrum of human scent without judgment
- **Humor as safety**: Playful, carnival aesthetic and "revolutionary" framing helps people laugh through awkwardness
- **Opt-out options**: Participants can smell without being smelled, can leave at any point, can participate partially
- **Diversity of bodies**: We explicitly welcome all bodies and actively work against narrow beauty standards. No body type, gender, size, or ability is excluded
- **Trained facilitators**: Crew trained in consent practices, de-escalation, and creating inclusive space
- **Debrief available**: Quick check-ins for anyone who had an unexpectedly intense experience

We've run versions of this at Burning Man successfully because the container is solid: it's weird enough that people expect weirdness, structured enough that they feel safe, and playful enough that vulnerability doesn't feel heavy.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, we serve botanical-themed snacks and water to cleanse palates between smells
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content (though it can feel intimate, it's framed as scientific/revolutionary, not sexual)

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:** 4ft √ó 6ft for the booth structure itself, plus ~6ft √ó 6ft queue/training area = total ~10ft √ó 6ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (peak dating hours), plus shorter sessions Friday/Sunday

### Structure Description
A 50" tall √ó 24" deep portable carnival-style booth with three circular apertures at different heights (accommodating various body types and mobility levels). The booth is decorated with:
- Ornate botanical illustrations of sweat glands and pheromone molecules
- Gold accents on a dark Gothic frame
- Cascading live vines and flowers (fire-code compliant)
- Hand-lettered signs in the style of vintage scientific diagrams: "The Armpit Index," "Broadcast Station #7," "Scent Intelligence Division"

The back side (participant side) has mirrors and encouraging signage. The front (smeller side) has baroque framing around each aperture with labels like "The Gut's Frequency," "Hormonal Broadcast," "Bacterial Uprising."

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Fire-retardant fabric and decorations (budget: $200)
- Live plants in fire-code compliant vessels ($150)
- Training materials: Scent sample vials, training cards, sommelier tools ($100)
- Signage and decorative elements ($100)
- Sanitation supplies: wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. ($50)
- Botanical snacks and palate cleansers ($100)

**Total Budget Request:** $700

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Scent Sommelier)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (Facilitator, Consent Captain)
- **[2-3 additional crew members to be recruited]**

### Staffing
- Minimum 2 people during operating hours
- 1 managing the queue and training
- 1 facilitating the booth and matchmaking
- Can operate in "passive mode" with signage if crew needs breaks

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes queer, trans, and gender non-conforming members. We're actively recruiting for more diversity and welcome anyone interested in joining.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Multiple heights:** Three apertures at different levels accommodate wheelchair users and different body heights
- **Flexible participation:** Can smell without being smelled, can watch without participating
- **Body positivity:** Explicitly anti-body-shaming. All bodies and their smells are valid and valued
- **Sensory considerations:** We're working with strong smells, which we acknowledge upfront. Participants can opt for brief exposure or can participate in other ways
- **Gender inclusivity:** Armpit smelling transcends gender categories‚Äîwe celebrate this as part of the piece

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew is finalized*

### Mentorship Program
Open to mentoring newer artists interested in consent-based interactive experiences.
