## Project Overview

### Description
The Mind tried to organize every body signal into neat categories. It built filing systems, indexes, and classification schemes. Then pheromones showed up‚Äîimpossible to categorize, refusing to stay filed. We're the overworked archivists documenting the glorious failure of bureaucratic body control. Your armpit gets a file. The file makes no sense. Welcome to embodied chaos.

### Experience Journey

1. **Intake Desk** ‚Äì Participants check in at our "records department" styled like a mid-century bureaucratic office being invaded by vines and botanical chaos
2. **File Creation** ‚Äì Fill out an official "Body Signal Documentation Form" with ridiculous bureaucratic questions about your armpit's categorical status
3. **The Sampling** ‚Äì Insert armpit through one of three apertures in our filing cabinet booth (disguised as oversized filing cabinet drawers)
4. **Failed Categorization** ‚Äì Trained "clerks" (Scent Sommeliers) attempt to file your pheromones using increasingly absurd category systems, all of which fail
5. **Official Documentation** ‚Äì Receive your permanent record: a beautifully designed file folder proving your body can't be properly categorized
6. **Cross-Reference Chaos** ‚Äì Browse the growing archive of misfiled bodies. Discover "matches" based on equally failing to fit any system

### Thematic Connection

The Mind loves bureaucracy. It creates systems, hierarchies, categories‚Äîways to control and predict. For centuries it's tried to file bodies away: male/female, healthy/sick, acceptable/deviant, attractive/unattractive. Neat boxes. Clean categories. Everything in its place.

But bodies leak. They sweat, they smell, they change. And pheromones? Pheromones are the ultimate bureaucratic nightmare. You can't standardize them. You can't predict them. You can't file "musky-sweet-with-notes-of-confusion" under any existing category without creating seventeen new subcategories that immediately contradict each other.

We're making this failure visible and beautiful. Our installation looks like a mid-century government office‚Äîfiling cabinets, intake forms, stamps, official documents‚Äîbut it's being overtaken by the botanical microbiome. Vines grow through drawers. Flowers bloom from paperwork. The orderly system is literally decomposing.

When participants stick their armpit into our filing cabinet "drawer," they're entering it into a system designed to organize and control. Our clerks dutifully try to categorize it: "Let's see, we'll file you under 'Pleasant Earthy'... no wait, there's a citrus note, that goes under 'Bright Acidic'... hold on, the undertone is changing as we speak..."

The Mind wants bodies to be static, knowable, controllable. The Body is dynamic, mysterious, alive. Your pheromones are proof that some aspects of embodiment simply refuse bureaucratic management.

This connects to how bodies have been used as commodities under capitalism‚Äîreduced to data points, measurements, categories that make us easier to market, control, and optimize. But smell? You can't fake your microbiome. You can't photoshop your pheromones. Your body broadcasts information the Mind can't manipulate.

Each participant leaves with official documentation of their categorical failure‚Äîa gorgeous file folder that celebrates their body's refusal to be properly organized. It's a document proving you exist outside the systems designed to contain you.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
Armpit smelling is inherently vulnerable. We create safety through:

- **Bureaucratic humor**: The absurdist office aesthetic creates psychological distance‚Äîyou're participating in a FILING SYSTEM, making the intimacy feel safer
- **Clear consent cascade**: Multiple check-in points, explicit descriptions, easy exits
- **Celebrating all bodies**: The whole point is that EVERY body fails categorization equally. All scents are valid data points.
- **Trained facilitators**: Crew comfortable with body-based work and consent practices
- **Multiple participation levels**: Can browse files without being filed, can watch the process, can fully engage
- **Body-positive language**: We use curious, appreciative language about all bodies and scents
- **Check-in protocols**: For anyone having unexpected reactions

The piece explicitly rejects body hierarchies and beauty standards. If you can't be properly categorized, you can't be properly judged.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience** (with passive browsing element)

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, "office coffee" and snacks (palate cleansers)
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:**
- Filing cabinet booth: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Intake desk: 3ft √ó 4ft
- Archive browsing area: 4ft √ó 6ft
- **Total:** Approximately 8ft √ó 10ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (primary), plus shorter Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Filing Cabinet Booth:** A 50" √ó 24" structure designed to look like an oversized mid-century filing cabinet with three "drawers" (apertures) that participants can access. The aesthetic is bureaucratic order being invaded by botanical chaos:
- Clean lines and office beige being overtaken by vines
- Official stamps and labels slowly becoming illegible under flower growth
- Metal filing cabinet aesthetic with gold botanical accents
- Live plants (fire-code compliant) growing through and around the structure
- Each "drawer" labeled with bureaucratic category names that contradict each other

**The Intake Desk:** Styled as a 1950s government office desk:
- Vintage typewriter and stamps
- Stacks of intake forms
- File folders and organizational systems
- All being slowly consumed by botanical growth
- Vines creeping across paperwork

**The Archive:** A display of "filed" participants:
- Vintage filing boxes stuffed with contradictory documentation
- Cross-reference cards that lead nowhere
- Beautiful chaos of misfiled bodies

**Aesthetic:** Mid-century bureaucratic order vs. botanical surrealism. Clean systems decomposing into gorgeous chaos.

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Mid-century office props: desk, typewriter, stamps, folders (borrowed/thrifted: $100)
- Fire-code compliant live plants and decorations ($200)
- Printing: Forms, file folders, certificates, stamps ($150)
- Decorative elements: vintage office supplies, signage ($100)
- Sanitation supplies ($50)
- "Office refreshments" (palate cleansers) ($100)

**Total Budget Request:** $700

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Head Archivist)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (Records Clerk, Consent Coordinator)
- **[2-3 additional crew TBD]** (Filing Clerks, Intake Processors)

### Staffing
- 2-3 people during peak hours
- 1 managing intake
- 1-2 facilitating filing attempts
- Can operate in passive mode with archive available for browsing

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes queer and gender non-conforming members. The piece explicitly challenges categorization systems that have been used to marginalize bodies.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Physical access**: Three aperture heights, furniture arranged for wheelchair access
- **Sensory considerations**: Strong smells disclosed upfront, alternative participation available
- **Body celebration**: ALL bodies fail categorization equally‚Äîthis is the point
- **Anti-oppression framing**: We're explicit that bureaucratic control of bodies has been a tool of oppression

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew is finalized*

### Mentorship Program
Open to mentoring artists interested in theme-integrated interactive work.
