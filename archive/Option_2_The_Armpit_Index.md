## Project Overview

### Description
The Mind tried to categorize every smell in The Body. It failed spectacularly. We're the research division documenting that failure‚Äîa Victorian-style naturalist expedition into the impossible taxonomy of human pheromones. Stick your pit through our sampling booth, get catalogued into our ever-expanding (and beautifully useless) Armpit Index, and discover why some things refuse to be filed away.

### Experience Journey

1. **The Archive** ‚Äì Enter our "research station" decorated like a 19th-century naturalist's field office: ornate botanical sketches, specimen jars, leather-bound ledgers with impossibly detailed categorization schemes
2. **Specimen Intake** ‚Äì Fill out an intake card with futile questions: "Describe your scent in three words the Mind would approve of" and "Which body part do you think is in charge right now?"
3. **The Sampling** ‚Äì Insert armpit through one of three apertures in our carnival booth. Multiple "researchers" (participants) take notes, attempt classification, inevitably contradict each other
4. **Cataloguing Failure** ‚Äì Receive your official entry in The Armpit Index: an absurdly ornate certificate with contradictory classifications, baroque botanical illustrations, and a unique specimen number
5. **Cross-Reference Chaos** ‚Äì Browse the growing index to see how spectacularly we're failing to create any coherent system. Find "matches" based on equally ridiculous non-categories

### Thematic Connection

Descartes tried to turn the body into a machine. The Mind has been categorizing ever since: male/female, clean/dirty, sick/healthy, acceptable/deviant. But stand in a room of human armpits and watch that system collapse.

You can't sort pheromones into neat boxes. Is it musky or sweet? Floral or fungal? Attractive or repulsive? The answer is yes. And no. And depends who's smelling. And changes by the hour. And has nothing to do with any of the categories the Mind insists matter.

This is the beautiful, freaky chaos the Mind can't control. Every armpit is a middle finger to Western taxonomy, a reminder that bodies aren't machines and refuse to be catalogued. The microbiome spreading across The Body isn't just connecting parts‚Äîit's dissolving the boundaries between them.

We're making the world's most elaborate, most baroque, most gorgeously useless classification system as a love letter to everything that refuses to be filed away. Your armpit gets a specimen number, an ornate certificate, and a place in our ever-growing archive of evidence that some things are gloriously, essentially, necessarily impossible to categorize.

This isn't just about smells. It's about every way we've been told our bodies should fit into boxes‚Äîgender, size, ability, beauty, health. Your pheromones are proof that your body was never going to cooperate with that project. It's too busy being alive, being in conversation with other bodies, being wonderfully, chaotically itself.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
Smelling stranger's armpits is vulnerable, potentially awkward, and deeply silly. Our approach:

- **Humor as container**: The absurdist "failed taxonomy" framing lets people laugh at the weirdness while exploring something genuinely intimate
- **Victorian aesthetics**: The ornate, "scientific" presentation creates psychological distance‚Äîyou're participating in RESEARCH, darling
- **Consent as process**: Multi-step opt-in, clear descriptions, easy outs at every stage
- **Celebrating all bodies**: The whole point is that categorization fails. Every body and every smell is equally valid evidence
- **Trained crew**: Facilitators comfortable with body-based work, consent practices, and creating inclusive space
- **Throughput options**: Can browse the index without participating, can smell without being smelled, can just get your certificate
- **Debrief available**: Check-ins for anyone processing unexpected feelings

The piece is explicitly anti-body-shaming and anti-categorization. We welcome all bodies, all smells, all identities as part of demonstrating how beautifully the Mind's filing system fails.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience** (with passive browsing element)

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, tea service and palate-cleansing snacks themed as "research provisions"
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:** 
- Booth structure: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Archive display table: 3ft √ó 6ft
- Queue/intake area: 6ft √ó 6ft
- **Total:** Approximately 8ft √ó 10ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (primary), plus shorter Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Sampling Booth:** 50" √ó 24" portable carnival structure with three apertures. Decorated to look like a Victorian specimen collection station:
- Dark wood-grain (or painted) exterior with ornate gold borders
- Botanical pheromone molecule illustrations in vintage scientific style
- Live potted plants and trailing vines (fire-code compliant) growing "through" the structure
- Baroque frames around each aperture labeled with mock-Latin specimen categories

**The Archive Station:** A separate display table styled as a naturalist's desk:
- Leather-bound ledgers (real or prop) filled with specimen entries
- Glass "specimen jars" with botanical elements and pheromone samples
- Index cards in a vintage card catalog
- Ornate certificates ready to be filled out
- Quill pens, ink wells, aged paper for intake forms

**Visual Aesthetic:** Botanical Surrealism meets Victorian Natural History. Think Darwin's field notes but make it about armpits and make it gorgeous.

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Archive furniture and display (owned/borrowed, some decoration budget: $150)
- Fire-code compliant botanical decorations, live plants ($200)
- Printing: Intake forms, certificates, index cards, specimen ledgers ($150)
- Victorian-style decorative elements, frames, props ($100)
- Sanitation supplies ($50)
- Tea service and snacks ($100)

**Total Budget Request:** $750

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Chief Taxonomist)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (Archive Keeper, Consent Coordinator)
- **[2-3 additional crew members to be recruited]** (Researchers, Specimen Handlers)

### Staffing
- 2-3 people during peak hours
- 1 managing intake and the archive
- 1-2 facilitating the booth
- Can operate in passive mode with the archive available for browsing

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts  
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service
- Emotional Spam

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes queer and gender non-conforming members. The piece explicitly challenges categorization systems that have been used to marginalize bodies. We're actively recruiting for broader representation.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Physical accessibility**: Multiple aperture heights, furniture arranged for wheelchair access, flexible participation levels
- **Sensory options**: Strong smells are part of the experience, which we acknowledge upfront; alternative participation available
- **Body inclusivity**: The entire concept celebrates that ALL bodies resist categorization. All body types, sizes, genders, and abilities are welcome and valued
- **Anti-oppression framing**: We're explicit that this is about challenging systems of categorization that have harmed marginalized communities

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew finalizes*

### Mentorship Program
Happy to mentor artists interested in consent-based interactive work or theme-integrated experiences.
