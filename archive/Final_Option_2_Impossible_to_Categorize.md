## Project Overview

### Description

Society spent centuries trying to sort bodies into neat categories. Then someone invented armpit-sniffing as a research methodology and the whole system collapsed. We're collecting evidence of that collapse‚Äîone anonymous pit at a time. Features: carnival booth glory holes, Scent Sommelier certification, and a growing archive proving humans are freaky, gross, profoundly silly, and utterly resistant to proper filing.

### Experience Journey

1. **The Research Facility** ‚Äì Discover our portable booth (new_booth2.jpg) decorated like it's trying to be a serious specimen collection cabinet but plants keep growing through everything and the organizational system makes no sense. It's beautiful chaos.

2. **The Hypothesis** ‚Äì Can you judge attraction without seeing someone? Can you categorize a person by their armpit alone? Spoiler: No. But watching people try is hilarious and occasionally profound.

3. **Self-Directed Chaos (2pm-1am daily):**
   - Read consent guidelines
   - Choose: be the smeller, the smelled, or both
   - Insert pit through aperture / smell anonymous pit
   - Try to categorize what you're experiencing (you'll fail)
   - Document your failure beautifully
   - Decide whether to reveal identities

4. **Guided Scientific Method (Staffed sessions):**
   
   **Phase 1: Visual Categorization Breakdown**
   - Only armpit visible‚Äîno other data
   - Name it based on appearance (Glitterpit? Old Man Whiskers? Something Ineffable?)
   - Realize you can't tell gender, age, "type," or anything The Mind usually relies on
   
   **Phase 2: Sensory Data That Won't Fit Anywhere**
   - Assess moisture, initial scent impression
   - Detailed analysis: nuttiness, earthiness, sweetness, acidity, that-thing-you-can't-name
   - Create flavor profile chart
   - Watch as your data refuses to match any known category
   
   **Phase 3: Your Body Has Opinions**
   - Rate attractiveness based on scent alone
   - Discover your body likes things your brain never would have chosen
   - Optional taste test for the scientific purists
   - Document everything on official Scent Slip
   
   **Phase 4: Official Certification**
   - Become a Scent Sommelier
   - Train others in the art of categorical failure
   - Contribute to our growing body of evidence

5. **Pheromone Matchmaking Protocol:**
   - Two participants, two pits, two noses, zero profiles
   - Both smell, both decide independently: compatible or pass
   - No match? Anonymity preserved, experiment continues
   - Mutual match? We introduce you, you discover if chemistry translates
   - Either way: more data proving attraction is weirder than categories

### Thematic Connection

**The impossible categorization of bodies is our whole deal.**

The Mind *loves* sorting: attractive/not, male/female, young/old, my-type/wrong-type. It feels natural, scientific even. We've built entire industries on this: dating apps, beauty standards, body commodification. Descartes started it in 1637 (body as machine), capitalism perfected it (body as product), and now we're all walking around thinking there's a "right" way to have a body.

**Then you smell someone's armpit.**

Suddenly every category explodes. You can't tell their gender from pheromones. Beauty standards don't apply to bacterial ecosystems. Age? Irrelevant. Your carefully curated "type"? Your nose doesn't care. All that's left is: "This smells like nutmeg and curiosity and something that makes my immune system very interested."

**That's your body refusing to be categorized.** And in that refusal is something important:

**Individual autonomy:** When you choose to stick your pit through our aperture, you're offering your body's truth‚Äîthe part you can't fake, can't optimize for the market, can't make socially acceptable. It's vulnerable. It's also powerful. You're saying: "Here's what my body actually is, unmediated by what The Mind thinks it should be."

**Collective freedom:** When someone smells you without judgment, without trying to fit you into a category, they're practicing a different way of relating to ALL bodies. They're learning that bodies can just be bodies‚Äîweird, smelly, resistant to filing. Every person who leaves understanding that categorization is bullshit makes space for more bodies to exist outside oppressive systems.

That's the North Star: "How does our individual experience of bodily autonomy connect to our collective freedom?" It connects through practice. Through choosing vulnerability. Through discovering that attraction is way freakier than any algorithm. Through collective laughter at how badly our categorization attempts fail.

**As Sonya Renee Taylor says:** "We must build in us what we want to see built in the world." We're building a world where bodies don't have to be commodified, optimized, or properly categorized. We're doing it through the most absurd method possible: anonymous armpit appreciation.

Also: bodies *are* freaky, gross, and profoundly silly. We're deeply committed to this truth.

### Supporting Participants

**Real talk:** This experience asks people to smell strangers' armpits. That's:
- Weird
- Vulnerable  
- Sometimes unexpectedly emotional
- Also very funny

**How we make it safe:**

**Consent Framework:**
- Clear explanations of what's involved
- Multiple opportunities to opt out
- Continuous right to stop
- Identity reveal only with mutual agreement
- Observation is valid participation too

**Trained Facilitators:**
- Body-positive language (no scent is "bad")
- Consent practices
- Recognizing and supporting distress
- Connecting to Art Safety if needed

**Radical Inclusivity:**
- ALL bodies welcome (all sizes, genders, abilities, scents)
- The whole point is that categorization fails‚Äîthere's no "right" kind of body
- Active work against beauty standards, fatphobia, transphobia, ableism
- Your body's refusal to be properly filed is celebrated, not judged

**Support Available:**
- Immediate check-ins if someone's struggling
- Quiet space nearby for processing
- Art Safety resources
- Follow-up during event

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience** + **Passive Interactivity**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, refreshments and palate cleansers
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual sensory experience (intimate but not sexual)

- **Anatomical surrealism** (image12.png Cat Butler's Venus style) - beautiful visceral sketches
- **Categorization attempts** (image17.png style) - drawers open showing failed filing systems
