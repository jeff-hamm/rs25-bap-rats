## Project Overview

### Description
Our cutting-edge matchmaking algorithm was supposed to optimize attraction using The Mind's preferred data: education, income, interests, photos. But something went wrong. Now it only works with armpits. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving. We're still trying to fix it. (We're not trying very hard.)

### Experience Journey

1. **App Interface** ‚Äì Enter our "tech startup" installation: sleek minimalist design being invaded by botanical chaos, screens showing "ERROR: SYSTEM MALFUNCTION"
2. **Profile Creation** ‚Äì Fill out a parody dating profile with all the usual Mind-approved questions (education, job, interests, height requirements)
3. **Algorithm Processing** ‚Äì Watch as the system "glitches," crosses out all your answers, and displays: "REVERTING TO BIOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY PROTOCOL"
4. **The Override** ‚Äì Insert armpit into one of three sleek apertures (designed to look like minimalist tech but overgrown with plants)
5. **Chemical Analysis** ‚Äì Other participants (or our "engineers trying to fix the system") analyze your pheromones as the algorithm frantically tries to categorize chemical data
6. **Match Results** ‚Äì Receive your "compatibility report": an increasingly desperate printout showing the algorithm's failure to make sense of your body's preferences
7. **Connection Optional** ‚Äì For those interested, we track whose bodies matched even though their profiles didn't, and facilitate meetings

### Thematic Connection

Dating apps are The Mind's ultimate attempt to rationalize attraction. Swipe based on photos, filter by height, sort by education level, match on shared interests. Everything categorized, everything optimized. The Mind loves this‚Äîturn intimacy into a sorting problem, reduce bodies to data points, apply an algorithm.

Then your body shows up and ruins everything.

Our installation is set up like a failed tech startup. The aesthetic is that clean minimalist design‚Äîwhite walls, sans-serif fonts, efficiency‚Äîbut it's being overtaken by the botanical microbiome. Vines grow through server racks. Flowers bloom from charging ports. The sleek surfaces are decomposing.

The central conceit is that our "revolutionary matchmaking algorithm" had a catastrophic malfunction. It was supposed to use rational Mind-approved criteria, but now it only responds to pheromones. We're "engineers" frantically trying to fix it while participants keep getting matched based on body chemistry instead of resume details.

When you create your dating profile, you fill out all the normal stuff: job, education, hobbies, what you're looking for. The system processes this, then glitches:

```
ERROR: INSUFFICIENT DATA
REVERTING TO BIOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY PROTOCOL
PLEASE INSERT ARMPIT FOR ANALYSIS
```

Your carefully curated profile gets crossed out. The Mind's categories are rejected. The algorithm demands chemical data instead.

This reveals how capitalism commodifies bodies and intimacy. Dating apps turn people into products to be sorted and sold. The Mind loves this because it creates the illusion of control‚Äîyou can optimize your attractiveness, target your market, maximize compatibility scores.

But your pheromones don't care about your job or your carefully selected photos. Your immune system is running compatibility checks the Mind doesn't understand. Your microbiome is looking for complementary bacteria. Your body has its own algorithm, one that evolved over millions of years and has nothing to do with your LinkedIn profile.

The piece is funny and accessible (everyone understands dating app frustration) while making a serious point: bodies resist commodification. You can't fake chemical compatibility. You can't photoshop your sweat. The Mind can try to reduce attraction to sortable categories, but The Body operates on a completely different system.

Each participant leaves with a "System Error" report showing how thoroughly their body rejected the Mind's categorization attempt. It's proof that you're more than your data.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
While lighter in tone than some options, this still involves intimate body interaction:

- **Humor as safety**: The "tech malfunction" framing creates distance and comedy
- **Clear consent protocols**: Multi-step opt-in, explicit descriptions, easy exits
- **Celebrating all outcomes**: Your body's preferences are valid, whether they match your brain's or not
- **Trained facilitators**: Crew comfortable with body-based work and consent practices
- **Flexible participation**: Can watch the "malfunction," can interact without being analyzed, can fully participate
- **Body-positive framing**: All bodies and pheromones are valid. The system doesn't reject YOU‚Äîit rejects categorization itself.
- **Support available**: Check-ins for anyone having unexpected reactions

The piece explicitly challenges beauty standards and dating hierarchies. You can't "optimize" your pheromones.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, "startup snacks" and refreshments (palate cleansers)
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:**
- Booth/algorithm interface: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Profile creation station: 3ft √ó 4ft
- "Server room" display: 4ft √ó 4ft
- **Total:** Approximately 8ft √ó 10ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (primary), plus Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Algorithm Interface:** 50" √ó 24" portable structure designed as a sleek tech kiosk:
- Minimalist white/gray surfaces
- LED screens showing error messages
- Three apertures styled as high-tech analysis ports
- Botanical elements aggressively growing through the clean design (fire-code compliant)
- Gold accents where plants break through
- Loading bars eternally stuck at "ANALYZING BIOLOGICAL DATA..."

**Profile Station:** Clean modern desk setup:
- Tablet or clipboard with profile forms
- Sleek aesthetic completely contradicted by botanical overgrowth
- "Upload your data" signage next to growing vines

**The Server Room:** Display area styled as:
- Tech equipment being consumed by plants
- Printouts of failed categorization attempts
- Match results showing body chemistry overriding profile preferences
- Growing archive of system malfunctions

**Aesthetic:** Silicon Valley minimalism being destroyed by botanical surrealism. The Mind's clean systems decomposing into The Body's organic chaos.

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Tech aesthetic props: screens, cables, modern furniture (borrowed/budget: $150)
- Fire-code compliant live plants and botanical decorations ($200)
- Printing: Profile forms, error messages, match reports ($100)
- Decorative elements: LED lighting, tech signage ($100)
- Sanitation supplies ($50)
- Refreshments and palate cleansers ($100)

**Total Budget Request:** $700

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Head Engineer)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (System Administrator, Consent Coordinator)
- **[2-3 additional crew TBD]** (Debug Team, User Support)

### Staffing
- 2-3 people during peak hours
- 1 managing profile creation
- 1-2 facilitating the "malfunction" and analysis
- Can operate in passive mode with error messages displayed

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes queer and gender non-conforming members. The piece challenges systems that commodify bodies and reduce people to data.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Physical access**: Multiple aperture heights, furniture accessible to wheelchairs
- **Sensory considerations**: Strong smells disclosed upfront, alternative participation available
- **Body celebration**: ALL bodies "break" the algorithm equally‚Äîthis is the point
- **Anti-commodification**: We explicitly reject systems that sort bodies into hierarchies

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew is finalized*

### Mentorship Program
Open to mentoring artists interested in accessible, humorous theme integration.
