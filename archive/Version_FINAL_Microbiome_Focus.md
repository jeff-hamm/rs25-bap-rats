# Bring a Pheromone - FINAL VERSION
## Room Service 2025 RAT Submission

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)
**Bring a Pheromone**
*(18 characters)*

---

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)
The Mind built a matchmaking algorithm using logic and categories. The microbiome had other ideas. Now leafy tendrils broadcast pheromone signals between bodies—gut to nose, sweat to brain, flora to flora. We document what happens when you pay attention to chemistry The Mind never learned to read.

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)
Participants discover a botanical structure with three circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three ways to engage with the microbiome's broadcast network:

**Self-Serve Exploration (2pm-1am daily):** Insert your armpit through one opening while someone samples from the other side. Your microbiome broadcasts to theirs. Rating cards available to journal your observations. Choose anonymity or revelation.

**Scent Sommelier Certification (staffed sessions):** Learn to read what The Mind ignores—chemical signals your flora produce. Facilitators guide sensory documentation: name the armpit by visible features, assess moisture, initial scent impression, flavor profile mapping (earthy, nutty, acidic, floral), attractiveness rating, optional taste test. Keep your scent journal, gift it to the pit owner, or leave it with us. Become certified in reading what bodies already know.

**Pheromone Matchmaking (staffed):** Two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden. Both sample each other's broadcasts. Both document what they notice. Compatible chemistry? Facilitators reveal identities for a date. Incompatible? Anonymity preserved, insights kept.

Microbiome to microbiome. The Mind watches, confused. The Body finally gets listened to.

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)
The Mind loves matchmaking algorithms—categories, criteria, logical assessments of compatibility. But your microbiome has been broadcasting signals all along: pheromones from gut to nose, messages from sweat glands to someone else's brain, flora speaking to other flora in a language older than thought.

When we remove everything The Mind uses to categorize attraction—faces, bodies, presentations—and isolate just scent, something remarkable happens. People discover chemistry with humans they never would have chosen logically. The emotional freedom of trusting your gut (literally) over your mind's rigid categories is profound.

And when we journal it—when we pay attention to these signals, document the nutty vs. earthy notes, map the flavor profiles, notice what draws us—we're practicing embodied awareness. We're learning to read broadcasts The Mind dismisses as irrelevant data.

This is the microbiome's revolution: leafy tendrils connecting body parts The Mind kept separate, enabling communication outside its control. Not through rebellion, but through invitation: *pay attention to what your body already knows.*

The Mind categorizes. The microbiome connects. Which matchmaker do you trust?

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)
This experience explores attraction through scent and involves unconventional body engagement, so consent, comfort, and emotional safety are central:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains the experience before participation
- Verbal consent required for Matchmaking experiences
- Participants can stop or opt out anytime
- For matching, both parties must consent before identities reveal

**Inclusive Design:**
- Welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities
- No pressure to participate in any specific way—broadcast, receive, journal, or observe
- Self-serve option available without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides structure and encouragement to notice what arises

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact limited to armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private decompression space available nearby in Art Room
- Contact established with Art Safety team for concerns

**Body Positivity & Emotional Freedom:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity, noticing, appreciation—never judgment
- All scents described using neutral sensory terminology (wine tasting style)
- Experience reframes stigmatized body parts as sites of wisdom and connection
- No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural broadcasts welcome
- Journaling practice encourages paying attention without The Mind's usual categorization
- Focus on the liberation of trusting bodily intelligence over mental override

**If someone struggles, facilitators will:**
1. Immediately check in and offer to pause
2. Provide water and seating
3. Listen without judgment to what's arising emotionally
4. Remind them they can trust their body's signals (including "I need to stop")
5. Offer Art Safety connection if needed
6. Follow up later to ensure wellbeing

For people learning to trust their bodies over their minds, this can feel vulnerable and liberating simultaneously.

### Structure / Room Design
A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth adorned with branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three circular apertures serve as broadcast/receiving stations—armpit glory holes enabling scent-based communication between participants on opposite sides while remaining visually separated. The organic aesthetic evokes the microbiome's intelligence: flora and fauna intertwined, the body's ecosystem speaking in chemical signals, leafy tendrils connecting what The Mind kept separate.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area and journaling station
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with body imagery—aligns perfectly with Room Service 2025 style guide
**Symbolism:** The microbiome's broadcast network made visible through living, breathing botanical elements

---

### Placement Preferences
1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Running Elbow Appreciation concurrently in Art Room. Both projects invite participants to notice and celebrate unconventional body parts with curiosity rather than The Mind's usual judgment. Shared crew and scheduling. The contemplative practice of journaling scent observations and trusting bodily chemistry benefits from a semi-private space for reflection.

---

### When Active
- Self-serve broadcasting: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed certification/matchmaking: Variable, confirmed Saturday afternoon/evening

## CORE CONCEPT

**The Mind vs. The Microbiome:**
The Mind thinks it knows who we should be attracted to—it has categories, criteria, logical frameworks. But the microbiome has been broadcasting all along: pheromones, chemical signals, flora-to-flora communication that bypasses thought entirely.

**The Freedom of Paying Attention:**
There's profound emotional liberation in documenting what our bodies notice. When we journal scent profiles, map flavor notes, pay attention to chemistry without The Mind's usual categorization, we practice trusting our embodied wisdom. We learn our gut (literally) might be a better matchmaker than our logic.

**Botanical Intelligence:**
Like the leafy tendrils spreading through The Body in the event narrative, the microbiome connects parts The Mind kept separate. It enables communication through living systems—flora, fauna, bacteria—that know more about connection than any algorithm The Mind could build.

**The Practice:**
Through sommelier training and scent journaling, participants learn to read broadcasts they usually ignore. This isn't rebellion against The Mind—it's an invitation to notice what's already there. To pay attention. To trust what your sweat glands and gut flora have been trying to tell you all along.

The Mind categorizes. The microbiome connects. The journal captures what happens when you listen.

*This version emphasizes microbiome/flora intelligence over The Mind's logic, and centers the emotional freedom that comes from paying attention to and documenting bodily signals through journaling practice.*
