# SECTION 1 \- Contact Info

## **Project Lead & Comms Lead**

Project Leads and Comms Leads are the main liaisons between collaborator crews and Take 3\. These are your project reps, and can be the same person. All project-related communication with T3 staff should happen through your project reps. All communications from T3 will be sent to your project reps, who are expected to share relevant information with the rest of their team.

**Now, dear Project Lead, it’s time to be honest with yourself \- how good are you at filling out forms and reading emails?** If you’re not confident, this is your opportunity to designate a Comms Lead to whom we’ll send emails and treat as the primary contact. If you designate a Comms Lead separate from your Project Lead, **please choose someone who is responsive and responsible to represent your team, and brief your crew on these expectations**. If you want information to be shared with your entire crew, consider making a Google-group or other shared email address and adding it here. If you do this, make sure to add art@, alexis@, and kaizo@take3presents.com to have posting privs to the group. You’ll also have a chance to list other collaborators later on.

# SECTION 2 \- Experience Design

## **Project Name\***

This is your legacy. Make it short and catchy. Please don’t use commas.

*\[SHORT ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 50\]*

**Bring a Pheromone**

## **Provide a brief synopsis of your project.\***

Just the elevator pitch to give us a rough sense of the concept. Keep it tight.  
*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 300\]*

Bring a Pheromone is a perspiration appreciation installation that allows us to experience each other, and find possible connection, through an interaction with anonymized armpits alone. We also offer official scent sommelier certification training and the latest Pheromone Tinder technology.

## **Describe the participant's journey.\***

Provide a play-by-play of what happens from the moment a participant engages in your project to the moment they disengage. Don't include narrative descriptions in this part, keep it pragmatic. A list works well for this. If you have a slide deck or other external link, use the next field.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 1000\]*

The pop-up Pheromone station offers several ways for participants to engage with our axillae anonymization apertures (glorified armpit glory-holes) as either the smeller, the smell-y, or both:

**Scent Sommelier Training:** invites passersby to partake in a Wine & Cheese type analysis of an unseen stranger in the Pheromone booth. When the station is staffed, we take the enterprising wanderer through a proper armpit smelling:  
 

* First, we name the armpit using a Rorschach-type analysis of the available armpit features (with names ranging from 'Old Man Whiskers' to '5pm Shadow' to 'Glitterpit').   
* Then, we sample the general moisture level and take an initial whiff of the overall scent and give it a general rating.   
* From there, we delve into each of the important characteristics of the smell (nuttiness, robustness, acidity and so on) to create a flavor profile graph which acts as a visualization of an individual’s scent.   
* Finally, the smeller is encouraged to go in for a taste.  
* We record all of this data on a sheet ([http://imgur.com/KMWdUHw](http://imgur.com/KMWdUHw)) which the smeller can either keep, give to the person in the booth, or leave with us.  
* Certified Scent Sommeliers can then take others through the experience if they choose

   
**Pheromone Tinder:** For interested participants, we also provide a pheromone based blind-dating service. 

* For this experience two consenting participants insert an armpit into the apertures from opposite sides of the booth, remaining otherwise hidden.  
* Both sample each other’s scent, choose to “sniff right” or “sniff left” and indicate their choices to our scent sommeliers  
* If their smells aren’t a match, they can choose to remain anonymous  
* If their olfactory tastes are compatible, we send them off on a date to explore their chemistry

## **Upload Materials**

Sketches, diagrams, presentations, examples, photos, etc.  
If you have any additional links to share, please paste **JUST THE LINK** here. If you have more than one resource to share, **make a drive folder** and link that here. \*\*\***Make sure link sharing is turned on.\*\*\***  
*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

## 

## **How does your project connect to the moral themes of this event? How does it build out our world? \[optional\]** 

*This is a thematic party and we prioritize original content created for this event. Projects that strongly incorporate the theme are more likely to be accepted. While we do accept non sequiturs, we hold a higher standard for the quality of those proposals.*

Some questions to consider as you draft your proposal:  
 

* How have our bodies been used as commodities, cogs in a capitalist machine? What impact has this had on individuals and our society? How can our bodies be tools of revolution?  
* Why is categorizing things so satisfying to our minds, and in what ways is it unsatisfying or harmful?  
* What does it mean to be embodied? How do you find embodiment?  
* How do our bodies make us similar? How do they make us different?  
* How do bodies change over time? How does that experience impact you?  
* How does the mind relate to the body?  
* What are conventional expectations around bodies, and what impact does that have?

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 1000\]*

In our pragmatic and visually focused world, we've lost touch with our instinctual modes of attraction. We look for mates based on superficial characteristics and criteria dictated by our logical brains in response to socially imposed norms. To find our way back to our truest form of interconnection we need to re-learn how to listen to our gut.

Bring a Pheromone challenges us to use our senses differently. By focusing our attention on the scent of another person, we can bypass our logical judgments of the human form and rediscover chemical compatibility. 

Our bodies are a symbiotic ecosystem of flora and fauna, and the often maligned armpit, with its distinctive individual odor, is a nexus of this microbial harmony. By isolating and exposing this transgressive zone of our biology and inviting others to experience us through our pheromones alone we allow a new part of our inner life to flourish. Through sensory deconstruction we can reconstruct our perception. Through disembodiment we become more embodied.

## **If your project deals with heavy themes, what is your plan for supporting participants who are having a challenging experience?\***

We trust our artists to make compelling, edgy art in safe, inclusive ways. This trust comes with an agreement from us to support you in developing this plan as your project evolves, and an agreement from you to take feedback and adapt your project as needed. Collaborators that do not take this precaution seriously and/or impact participants negatively due to negligence will face consequences. All that said, we are actively seeking art that stretches comfort zones and thoughtfully encourages people to explore the edges of their boundaries. 

As you answer this question, please try to consider how people of different backgrounds and identities might experience your project, including but not limited to: BIPOC, working class, queer, trans/gender non-conforming, disabled, and/or people who are part of another marginalized identity. 

Be considerate of others and follow the [Art Rules](https://www.take3presents.com/art-rules) and [The Principles](https://www.take3presents.com/our-culture) (pw: sasquatch). If you need clarification about an Art Rule and how it might impact your project, reach out to [artsafety@take3presents.com](mailto:artsafety@take3presents.com) with any questions or concerns.  If your art contains sexual content, read the [Sex Art Safety Guidelines](https://www.take3presents.com/art-rules#sex-art).  

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 1500\]*

Our project uses scent and interactive play to ask questions of the body's indigenous chemistry and challenge our ingrained perceptions in a rich, humorous, and consensual context. While it engages the senses in new and intimate forms, we create each experience with clear consent protocols, respect for personal boundaries, and sensitivity to diverse backgrounds and levels of comfort.

## **How would you describe the participant experience?\***

If your experience falls into more than one of these categories, pick the one it will most often embody: 

* Chill space (for lounging, no performance and low interactivity)  
* Passive interactivity (at the viewers own pace)  
* Open-ended interactive experience (shticking with active artists, but no set journey)  
* Guided experience (they are on a set journey from start to end)  
* Dance party (‘nuff said)


*\[MULTIPLE CHOICE\]*

## 

## **How would you describe the interaction/tone/purpose?\***

If your experience falls into more than one of these categories, pick up to three that most reflect the vibe of your project.

* Introspective & Reflective  
* Silly & Absurd  
* Energetic & Wild  
* Playful & Flirtatious  
* Investigative & Curious  
* Comforting & Cozy  
* Surreal & Otherworldly  
* Ritualistic & Sacred  
* Confrontational & Provocative  
* Functional & Utility


*\[MULTI-SELECT\]*

## **Safety\***

## Do you plan to serve any food or drink as part of your project?

If you do plan to serve food/drink, read the [Food Safety Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHi0dmg2H1zCUeIwoJA4u4s9ETyn-4aQ0Bj6FgKrrnA/edit)  
*\[YES OR NO\]*

## Do you plan to do anything intentionally sexual for your art?

If you are planning to do sexy stuff, read the [Sex Art Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1rzyEV2xjaEVpgXrE_HoKpj7aw5zbaMExwm4V1z0qU/edit#heading=h.va6ud33iltkx)  
*\[YES OR NO\]*

## **Is the experience static or roaming? \***

“Static” means that you need permanent placement. If you don’t need permanent placement, select “Roaming”.

*\[MULTIPLE CHOICE, SELECT ALL THAT APPLY\]*

* Roaming  
* Art Room Static  
* Non-Art Room Static


## **Have you purchased an art room?**

If so, what is the room number, name on the booking, and room code?

*\[MULTIPLE CHECK BOXES, AND SHORT ANSWER\]*

We have a queen art room, which we will be sharing with several other RATs, but are waiting for our final room number assignment. We have requested placement near our sleeping suite as the project lead for this RAT recently had a hip replacement and has limited mobility. Below is the info for our room:

05.2 Bally’s  
Room Code: (DTS): DNN9XX  
Booking Name: Bex Bourgeois

## **Art footprint**

Estimate the footprint for your static project ONLY, not mobile art parking, not prop storage. Provide an answer like: 5 x 5 ft.  
*\[LONG ANSWER\]*

## **Structure / Room Design**

Describe the physicality of your project briefly. Please include the size. For example:  
“A reskinned 10x10’ EZ-up decorated to look like a small cottage. The interior will be decorated to look like the home of a teddy bear.” or  
“Floor to ceiling bleachers of wood construction enclosing a space for jello wresting taking up 1/2 of a suite with the other half converted into a lounge."

*\[LONG-ANSWER\]*

The pop-up Pheromone station is a folding three sided booth made of thin plywood attached to a sturdy metal frame. The front facade is 30” wide x 75” high with two 15” wide x 75” high side panels that fold back at a 45 degree angle. 

The booth is hand painted with surrealist anatomical images and adorned with floral decor.

The front facade has two holes cut at approximately armpit height and a curtained opening at the bottom that allows participants to crawl behind it. It is designed to be set up in nearly any location. As part of our art room it would be installed in a corner or bathroom doorway as one of the services offered by our Anatomy Appreciation Collective.

**Structure MockUp**

Do you have a sketch, diagram, or map to get a sense of the physicality of your project? This can be from the upload materials above, but please choose something that represents the actual structure (vs. inspirational imagery and interaction design).

## **Static Placement Notes**

Are there any requests you’d like to make about your placement that could help us decide where it should go?

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT \- CHARACTER LIMIT 500\]*

## **What are your sound needs?\***

This is a party, so there is no true quiet; that said, we try our best to place projects that require a quieter environment away from projects that are louder.

* Needs (relative) quiet  
* Amplified background/ambient sound  
* Loud amplified sound and/or music  
* None of the above

*\[MULTIPLE CHOICE\]*

## **Renegade Dance Party / Music Set**

Telling us about your renegade helps us place you appropriately, give you plenty of power, work with you to avoid overlap with similar music elsewhere, and maybe even help you source a better sound system or intro you to a headliner who wants an extra set.

*\[YES / NO AND LONG TEXT\]*

## **Power Draw**

How much power draw (in amps if possible)?  
(If you don't feel really confident about how to answer this, don't worry\! It's confusing. Either way, list devices that you're using.)  
If you don't need power, leave this blank.

\[*LONG TEXT\]*

## ***High Power Draw***

If you know you're gonna be a high power draw, check the box. If you're doing any heating or cooling, it's a yes \- check the box. If you don't know, leave it blank.

*\[CHECK BOX\]*

## **When will this project be active?\***

This isn’t binding, just give us a rough sense of what you are thinking. 

Please note: most daytime activity happens at the pool, whereas art rooms tend to be visited in the night & late night. As this is typically a late night party, we prioritize projects that can be active late night/dawn.

* Afternoons \~1-5pm: Fri, Sat, Sun  
* Evenings \~5-9pm: Fri, Sat, Sun  
* Nights \~9pm-1am: Fri, Sat, Sun  
* Late Night/Dawn \~1-5am: Fri, Sat, Sun

# SECTION 5 \- Crew

## **Specify roles within your crew\***

List roles (and names if you have them) for each comp ticket. It’s okay if you haven’t filled all the roles yet. For larger projects, we recommend multiple leads or delegating out responsibilities like admin/scheduling and build/strike lead to multiple people.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

## **Direct Ticket Sales requested**

DTS sale closes on Friday, 9/12, so requests must come in no later than Monday, 9/8 to be considered. DTS resources are not guaranteed.

\[NUMBER INPUT\]

## **List any sponsored or unsponsored art you or your crew members have made for past Take 3 events.**

We’re more likely to accept people who have a history of bringing great work to our events, whether or not it was funded.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

# SECTION 6 \- Artist Support (optional)

Take 3 is invested in creating an accessible, safe and supportive community for all. We want to learn more about how to support those who are interested in making work with us. Your answers will help us in this journey, but are not required.

## 

## **Do you or any of your crew members identify as BIPOC, working class, queer, trans/gender non-conforming, disabled, and/or part of another marginalized identity?**

We know that the circumstances caused by systemic, historical oppression make it more difficult for some people to participate. To fight against this dynamic, we would like to consider identity as we accept projects and grant resources so we can be more equitable in our distribution of resources. This also helps us gauge the impact of our efforts to shift the diversity of our collaborator pool over time. If you have further questions/feedback on how this information will be used or why we’re asking for it, please ping Kaizo or Maddie on Slack or email (kaizo[@take3presents.com](mailto:ad@take3presents.com) and/or maddie[@take3presents.com](mailto:alexis@take3presents.com))

*\[YES/NO/OTHER\]*

## 

## **If yes, please elaborate to the extent that you are comfortable.**

Knowing how many people and how they identify is helpful. Feel free to include questions, concerns, or suggestions for how we can support you.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

## **Do you have any suggestions for how we might make our events more inclusive, safe or accessible for people of marginalized identities?**

Your answers will be shared with a small committee of people dedicated to making concrete and actionable recommendations for leadership to consider for this or future events.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

## 

## **Do you or any of your crew members have access needs that you would like to share with us?**

If so, we would love to hear any suggestions you have for how we can best support you.

*\[LONG ANSWER TEXT\]*

The project lead for this RAT recently had a hip replacement and has limited mobility. We have a queen art room, and have requested placement near our sleeping suite. Below is the info for our art room:

05.2 Bally’s  
Room Code: (DTS): DNN9XX  
Booking Name: Bex Bourgeois

## **Do you have any ideas for ways we could improve our support for artists?**

We strive for our artists to feel supported in realizing their creative vision AND have a great time before & during the event. Please let us know anything we can do to make this goal a reality. We’re also combing through feedback from past events, but we may miss something. We intend to keep this conversation going throughout the event cycle, and encourage feedback early & often.
