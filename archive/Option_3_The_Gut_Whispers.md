## Project Overview

### Description
The Gut has been in exile, but it's sending messages. Through pheromones. Through your armpits. We're a listening station for the resistance‚Äîtraining people to decode chemical signals the Mind can't intercept. Three glory holes in a carnival booth. One mission: hear what your body is trying to tell you when your brain isn't looking.

### Experience Journey

1. **The Briefing** ‚Äì Approached by Resistance members who explain: The Mind has blocked communication between body parts. But the Gut found a way. It's broadcasting through your sweat glands. Can you hear it?
2. **Signal Training** ‚Äì Quick workshop using sample pheromones. Learn to distinguish "gut-to-brain bypass" from regular body funk. Identify notes of rebellion.
3. **Transmission** ‚Äì Put your armpit through one of three apertures. Other participants trained as Signal Interpreters decode what your gut is broadcasting.
4. **Message Translation** ‚Äì Get feedback: Is your gut reaching out to other guts? Calling body parts to unite? Broadcasting coordinates for the revolution? Or just saying it's hungry and the Mind needs to shut up about it?
5. **Gut Network Optional** ‚Äì For those who want to join the organized resistance, we facilitate "gut resonance matching"‚Äîwhose microbiomes are trying to connect? Exchange info if interested.

### Thematic Connection

The Friday night narrative is about the Mind questioning body parts to find the culprit for the botanical uprising. Body parts are revolting and searching for the exiled Gut to reclaim control from the Mind. **We are that search made literal.**

Your gut has been in exile‚Äîshamed, ignored, told it doesn't know what's good for you. The Mind insists it's in charge, categorizing and controlling every bodily process. But your gut never stopped trying to communicate. It just had to get creative.

Pheromones are the Gut's underground railroad. Chemical messages traveling through your bloodstream, out your sweat glands, into the air, into someone else's nose, straight to *their* gut. No conscious thought required. No Mind oversight possible.

When you smell someone's armpit, you're not just detecting bacteria. You're receiving a transmission from their gut microbiome‚Äîa signal that bypasses both your Mind and theirs. It's body-to-body communication, the kind the Mind has spent centuries trying to suppress because it can't control what it can't categorize.

This is about remembering that your body has wisdom your brain doesn't want to hear. Your gut knows things‚Äîabout danger, about compatibility, about what you need‚Äîthat your Mind refuses to accept. The microbiome spreading across The Body isn't just connecting parts. It's teaching them to trust each other more than they trust the tyrannical librarian upstairs.

Every person who comes to our listening station is joining the revolution. Every armpit is a broadcasting tower. Every gut finding resonance with another gut is proof that the body parts are uniting, that the Gut's message is getting through, that the Mind's control is slipping.

Bodies know. Bodies communicate. Bodies organize revolution through channels the Mind can't intercept. Your armpits are part of that network, whether your brain consents or not.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
This is intimate, vulnerable, and aggressively weird. We handle it through:

- **Narrative container**: The "resistance" framing gives people a reason to be vulnerable beyond just "it's fun and weird"
- **Clear consent cascade**: Multiple opt-in points, explicit descriptions, easy exits
- **Revolutionary body politics**: This explicitly celebrates bodies that have been shamed, ignored, or categorized as "wrong." All bodies are part of the uprising.
- **Humor balances heaviness**: It's a serious metaphor wrapped in an absurd presentation (glory holes, carnival aesthetics, sommelier training)
- **Trained facilitators**: Crew experienced with body-based interactive art and consent practices
- **Flexible participation**: Can listen without broadcasting, can get the briefing without participating, can browse "decoded messages" from past participants
- **Check-in protocols**: For anyone having an unexpectedly intense experience

We're explicit that this piece celebrates bodies of all types, sizes, abilities, genders, and smells. The Mind tried to categorize bodies as acceptable/unacceptable. The Gut doesn't work that way. All signals are valid.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, gut-friendly fermented snacks and drinks (probiotics for the revolution)
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content (intimate but not sexual)

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:** 
- Booth: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Training/queue area: 6ft √ó 6ft
- Message display area: 3ft √ó 4ft
- **Total:** Approximately 8ft √ó 10ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (peak resistance hours), plus shorter Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Listening Station (booth):** 50" tall √ó 24" deep portable carnival structure with three apertures at varied heights. Decorated as a makeshift resistance outpost:
- Dark, weathered exterior with botanical elements growing through cracks
- Gold accents suggesting hidden value in rejected spaces
- Hand-painted signage: "Listening Station #7," "Gut Signals Only," "Mind Bypass in Progress"
- Live plants and vines (fire-code compliant) visually connecting the apertures
- Gothic/baroque frames around apertures with labels like "Lower Frequency," "Gut Resonance," "Microbiome Broadcast"

**The Training Area:** A separate station with:
- Sample vials of pheromones for training
- Illustrated guides to "reading gut signals"
- Resistance propaganda: posters about the Mind's tyranny
- Decoded message archive from previous participants

**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism meets underground resistance. Beautiful but scrappy. Ornate but illicit.

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Fire-retardant decorative fabric and elements ($150)
- Live plants in compliant containers ($150)
- Training materials: sample vials, guides, signage ($100)
- Display materials for message archive ($50)
- Sanitation supplies ($50)
- Fermented snacks and drinks for theme ($150)

**Total Budget Request:** $650

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Head Signal Interpreter)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (Resistance Coordinator, Consent Guardian)
- **[2-3 additional crew members TBD]** (Signal Interpreters, Queue Management)

### Staffing
- 2-3 people during operating hours
- 1 managing training and queue
- 1-2 facilitating the booth and message translation
- Can operate in reduced capacity with signage during crew breaks

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes members of marginalized communities. The piece explicitly centers bodies that have been told they're wrong‚Äîtoo fat, too queer, too disabled, too smelly, too much. The Gut doesn't care about those categories.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Physical access**: Three aperture heights accommodate different bodies and abilities, wheelchair-accessible layout
- **Sensory considerations**: Strong smells are integral and disclosed upfront; alternative participation modes available
- **Body celebration**: ALL bodies broadcast. ALL signals matter. We explicitly reject beauty standards and ability hierarchies.
- **Gender freedom**: Armpits transcend gender. We celebrate this as part of the revolution.
- **Economic access**: No pressure to buy anything; the experience is fully funded

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew is confirmed*

### Mentorship Program
Open to mentoring artists interested in theme-integrated, body-positive interactive experiences.
