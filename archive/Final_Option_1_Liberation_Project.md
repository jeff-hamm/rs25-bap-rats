## Project Overview

### Description

Descartes said your body is a machine. Capitalism turned it into a product. Your armpit disagrees. It sweats, it smells, it broadcasts chemical truth you can't fake or optimize. We're a carnival booth where The Body gets to talk back‚Äîthrough three glory holes, some very serious Scent Sommelier training, and the radical act of letting strangers smell your pits.

### Experience Journey

1. **The Absurd Proposal** ‚Äì Encounter our portable booth (see new_booth2.jpg) decorated like a Victorian specimen cabinet that's being invaded by plants. Signs read things like "Your Body Has Opinions" and "Descartes Was Wrong (And Also Kind of a Dick)"

2. **Choose Your Adventure:**
   - **Get Certified:** Scent Sommelier training where we teach you to appreciate armpits like wine. You'll name them (Old Man Whiskers, Glitterpit, 5pm Shadow), rate their nuttiness and earthiness, create flavor profiles, maybe even taste test. Leave with an official certificate.
   - **Get Smelled:** Stick your pit through one of three apertures. Other participants analyze your unique bacterial bouquet while you remain delightfully anonymous.
   - **Find Your Match:** Pheromone-based blind dating. Two pits, two noses, zero questionnaires. Sniff right or sniff left. If you match, we introduce you. If not, your secret is safe.

3. **The Twist** ‚Äì Our booth is decorated with hidden faces in floral patterns (image19.png style), anatomical sketches meeting botanical surrealism (image12.png Cat Butler vibes), and specimen drawers slightly open revealing weird categorization attempts (image17.png). The aesthetic says: "We tried to organize bodies into neat systems and it got gloriously weird."

4. **Documentation** ‚Äì Keep your scent slip, share it with your pit-provider, or add it to our growing archive of bodies refusing to be properly categorized.

### Thematic Connection

**Here's the silly-serious part:**

For 400 years we've been told bodies are machines to control. Under capitalism they became products to optimize. Every deodorant ad, every diet, every beauty standard is trying to make your body market-ready.

Your armpit is having none of it.

You can Photoshop your face. You can curate your Instagram. You can't fake your bacterial ecosystem. Your pheromones broadcast your immune markers, your hormone levels, your microbiome composition‚Äîall the truth your conscious mind can't manipulate.

**The Mind loves categories:** attractive/unattractive, male/female, my-type/not-my-type. But stick your nose near someone's armpit and watch those categories collapse. Gender? Irrelevant. Age? Can't tell. Conventional beauty? Doesn't register. All that's left is: "Hmm, nutty with citrus notes and something I can't quite name but my body is VERY interested in."

**That unnamed something is bodies talking to other bodies.** Chemical compatibility, immune system recognition, bacterial harmony‚Äîinformation that exists completely outside The Mind's filing system. When you discover you're attracted to someone's smell but wouldn't have swiped right on their profile? That's your body refusing to be commodified.

**The North Star:** "How does our individual experience of bodily autonomy connect to our collective freedom?"

Every time someone sticks their armpit through our aperture, they're practicing bodily autonomy at its most vulnerable and absurd. They're saying: "My body has wisdom. It's weird and smelly and I'm sharing it anyway." Every time someone smells without judging, they're learning to witness bodies as they are, not as systems demand they should be.

It's silly. It's gross. It's freaky. It's also practice for a world where bodies aren't commodities‚Äîthey're just bodies, being gloriously themselves.

**As Sonya Renee Taylor says:** "We must build in us what we want to see built in the world." We're building it one armpit at a time.

## Project Overview

### Description

For 400 years, we've lived with Descartes' lie: the body is a machine to be controlled by the rational mind. Under capitalism, that machine became a commodity‚Äîto be optimized, marketed, controlled. Your armpit knows better. It broadcasts chemical truth your consciousness can't fake. We're building a practice of bodily autonomy as collective liberation, one smell at a time.

Our portable booth is a cathedral to biological resistance: ornate as an Orchid Cabinet, visceral as anatomical art, decorated with hidden faces emerging from botanical chaos. Three apertures invite you to submit the body part society says you should hide‚Äîand discover that vulnerability is revolutionary.

### Experience Journey

1. **Reclamation Space** ‚Äì Enter an installation styled after Victorian specimen cabinets (Madeline von Foerster's Orchid Cabinet aesthetic) but overgrown with living botanicals. The rigid categorization systems are literally decomposing.

2. **The Offering** ‚Äì Read reflections on bodily autonomy: quotes from Sonya Renee Taylor, histories of bodies as commodities, testimonials from participants who've discovered power in scent-based connection.

3. **Submission as Resistance** ‚Äì Insert your armpit through one of three apertures in our movable booth. The booth is decorated with hidden faces in floral patterns (echoing the Style Guide's hidden faces motif), anatomical sketches meeting botanical surrealism, gems and gold accents on dark Gothic surfaces.

4. **Witnessed Truth** ‚Äì Other participants smell your pheromones‚Äîthe one body signal you can't optimize, can't fake, can't make "market-ready." Your bacterial truth is smelled and celebrated.

5. **Collective Recognition** ‚Äì Facilitators (trained Scent Sommeliers) guide smellers in appreciating what they encounter: not judging, not categorizing as "good/bad," but experiencing embodied truth. We document observations in ornate journals styled after anatomical specimen books.

6. **Building Freedom** ‚Äì Participants who discover resonance (chemical, energetic, solidarity-based) can connect. We facilitate introductions framed as: "Your bodies recognized something. Do you want to explore what that is?"

7. **Integration** ‚Äì Leave with a hand-illustrated card (echoing Cat Butler's anatomical art style) acknowledging your participation in collective liberation through individual bodily autonomy.

### Thematic Connection: Bodily Autonomy as Collective Freedom

**The North Star question is central to everything we're doing:** "How does our individual experience of bodily autonomy connect to our collective freedom?"

Here's how we answer it:

#### Individual Autonomy

When you choose to stick your armpit through our aperture, you're practicing bodily autonomy at its most vulnerable. You're saying: "My body has wisdom that exists independently of social control. I choose to share that truth."

This is the opposite of how we've been conditioned. Since Descartes declared the body a machine in 1637, we've been taught that rational mind control over the body is virtue. Capitalism doubled down: your body is a commodity to optimize, a tool to make productive. Every deodorant ad, every diet culture message, every beauty standard is the Mind trying to make your body market-ready by suppressing its truth.

Your armpit refusing to cooperate with that project is bodily autonomy. It smells how it smells. It broadcasts your bacterial ecosystem, your hormone levels, your immune markers‚Äîall information your conscious mind can't manipulate. When you offer that truth to be witnessed (not judged, not evaluated, just smelled and appreciated), you're reclaiming your body from commodity status.

#### Collective Freedom

But here's where individual autonomy becomes collective liberation:

**Every body that refuses categorization makes space for other bodies to do the same.**

When someone smells your armpit and responds with curiosity instead of judgment, with appreciation instead of hierarchical evaluation, they're learning a new way to relate to ALL bodies. They're practicing witnessing bodies as they are, not as systems of control demand they should be.

This is what Sonya Renee Taylor means by "We must build in us what we want to see built in the world." You can't build a world free from body-based oppression without first transforming your own relationship to your body AND other bodies. Our installation is that practice, compressed into 10 minutes of armpit-smelling.

**The political work happens in layers:**

1. **Personal:** Reclaiming your own body from internal policing
2. **Interpersonal:** Learning to witness others' bodies without imposing categorization
3. **Collective:** Building a community that celebrates bodies refusing to be controlled
4. **Systemic:** Every person who leaves understanding bodies differently weakens the systems that commodify them

#### The Specificities

We're not abstract about this. Our booth celebrates the bodies most marginalized by categorization systems:

- **All sizes:** Pheromones have nothing to do with body size, directly challenging fatphobia
- **All genders:** Armpit smell transcends gender categories, challenging binary thinking
- **All abilities:** Our apertures accommodate different heights and mobilities
- **All ages:** Chemical attraction doesn't follow ageist beauty standards
- **All scents:** We explicitly celebrate that every bacterial ecosystem is unique and valuable

When a fat person, a trans person, a disabled person discovers their pheromones are appreciated‚Äînot despite their body but AS their body's truth‚Äîthat's liberation. When the person doing the appreciating learns that attraction exists outside conventional categories, that's consciousness transformation. When both people realize bodies have been commodified and controlled to keep us disconnected from each other, that's political awakening.

#### The Freaky/Gross/Silly Sacred

The metatheme says: "bodies are freaky, gross, and profoundly silly." We're deeply committed to this.

Armpits ARE gross by social standards. They're sweaty, smelly, hairy (or not). They're the body part you're supposed to shave/hide/deodorize to be acceptable. Making them the site of connection and celebration is absurdist and profound.

The silliness‚Äîthe carnival booth aesthetic, the glory holes, the Scent Sommelier training‚Äîcreates psychological safety for vulnerability. You can laugh while doing revolutionary work. The freakiness is what makes it memorable. The grossness is what makes it honest.

But underneath the play is dead serious: reclaiming bodies from systems of control, building collective liberation through individual autonomy, practicing the world we want to create.

### Supporting Participants

This work is vulnerable and potentially activating. We create safety through:

**Philosophical Framework:**
- Clear articulation of the political/liberatory purpose
- Consent as ongoing practice, not one-time agreement
- Space held for people processing body-based trauma, dysphoria, or oppression

**Facilitation Training:**
- Crew trained in body liberation politics
- Understanding of how body-based oppression affects different identities
- Trauma-informed practices for people having activating experiences

**Inclusive Design:**
- Celebration of ALL bodies as sites of wisdom and resistance
- No body or scent is better/worse‚Äîall are evidence of embodied truth
- Active work against replicating beauty standards, ableism, racism, transphobia, fatphobia

**Support Protocols:**
- Immediate check-ins if someone is struggling
- Connection to Art Safety resources
- Quiet space for processing
- Follow-up availability

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience** with contemplative/reflective elements

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, botanical teas and palate cleansers  
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual, though intimate and potentially emotionally intense
