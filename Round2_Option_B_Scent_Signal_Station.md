## Project Overview

### Description
Your body parts want to talk to each other, but the Mind keeps blocking the signals. Pheromones are how your gut reaches your nose, your sweat glands talk to someone else's brain, your microbiome broadcasts to other microbiomes. We're a signal station amplifying the conversations your body is already having‚Äîhelping you tune into frequencies the Mind can't monitor.

### Experience Journey

1. **Signal Detection** ‚Äì Approach our station decorated like a vintage radio broadcast facility being overgrown with botanical life
2. **Frequency Training** ‚Äì Brief workshop on "tuning in" to body signals using sample pheromones and scent exercises
3. **Broadcasting** ‚Äì Insert armpit through one of three apertures in our signal booth. Your pheromones broadcast on your unique frequency.
4. **Reception** ‚Äì Other participants tune into your signal, decoding what your body is broadcasting
5. **Translation** ‚Äì Get feedback on your body's messages: What's your gut saying? Are your sweat glands reaching out? Is your microbiome looking for compatible flora?
6. **Signal Matching** ‚Äì Optional: We track which body signals resonate with each other and can facilitate connections

### Thematic Connection

The Mind thinks it's the only communication system in the body. It sends signals down through nerves, issues commands, receives reports. Very hierarchical. Very controlled. Very Mind.

But bodies have been talking to each other since before brains existed. Chemical signals, pheromones, microbiome exchanges‚Äîthis is the original network. Your gut produces neurotransmitters. Your skin broadcasts your immune system status. Your armpit houses billions of bacteria creating a signature scent that changes based on stress, diet, hormones, health.

All of this is information. All of this is communication. The Mind just isn't invited to the conversation.

At our Scent Signal Station, we make these invisible broadcasts visible (or rather, smellable). When you put your armpit through our aperture, you're not just letting someone smell you‚Äîyou're broadcasting your body's current state on multiple frequencies:

- Your bacterial frequency (microbiome composition)
- Your hormonal frequency (stress, arousal, mood)
- Your immune frequency (compatibility markers)
- Your gut frequency (what your digestive flora is up to)

Other participants become signal receivers, tuning into these broadcasts and translating what they pick up. "I'm detecting high anxiety notes." "This microbiome is looking for compatible bacteria." "The gut is broadcasting 'hungry and slightly annoyed.'"

This connects to the event theme because it reveals how much communication happens *outside* the Mind's awareness and control. Your body is constantly in conversation with other bodies‚Äîrecognizing kin, detecting threats, seeking compatible biology. The Mind tries to categorize these responses ("I find this person attractive because they have nice hair"), but that's just the Mind trying to make sense of body-level communication it doesn't understand.

The microbiome spreading through The Body in the event narrative is literally about this: body parts learning to communicate directly with each other, bypassing the Mind's categorization and control. Your pheromones are part of that network.

We're not as revolutionary as the Underground or as narratively central as Gut Whispers‚Äîwe're just technicians helping amplify signals that were already there. Your body was already broadcasting. We're just helping you tune in.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
This experience involves intimate body-level interaction. We create safety through:

- **Technical framing**: The "signal station" metaphor creates distance‚Äîyou're just transmitting DATA
- **Clear consent protocols**: Multi-step opt-in, explicit descriptions, continuous right to stop
- **Celebrating all signals**: Every broadcast is valid and interesting. No body or scent is better/worse.
- **Trained operators**: Crew comfortable with body-based work, consent practices, and creating inclusive space
- **Flexible participation**: Can receive signals without broadcasting, can observe without participating
- **Body-positive language**: Curious, appreciative terminology about all bodies and their communications
- **Support available**: Check-ins for anyone processing unexpected reactions

The piece welcomes all bodies, all identities, all microbiomes. Every signal matters.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, refreshments and palate cleansers
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:**
- Signal booth: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Training station: 4ft √ó 6ft
- Reception area: 4ft √ó 4ft
- **Total:** Approximately 8ft √ó 10ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (primary), plus Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Signal Booth:** 50" √ó 24" portable structure designed to look like a vintage radio broadcast station:
- Art deco lines and bronze/copper aesthetics
- Dials, gauges, and frequency indicators
- Three "broadcast apertures" at different heights
- Botanical elements growing through the equipment (fire-code compliant live plants)
- Warm lighting suggesting active transmission
- Labels like "Gut Frequency," "Microbiome Band," "Pheromone Channel"

**The Training Station:** A separate area with:
- Sample pheromones for "frequency training"
- Visual guides to "reading signals"
- Charts showing body communication systems
- Botanical decorations suggesting network growth

**The Reception Area:** Display of "received signals":
- Participant feedback about broadcasts they've detected
- Signal compatibility matches
- Network map showing body-to-body connections

**Aesthetic:** Vintage radio technology meets botanical network. Art deco order being overtaken by organic growth.

### Materials
- Portable booth structure (owned)
- Vintage radio/broadcast props and decorations ($150)
- Fire-code compliant live plants and botanical elements ($150)
- Training materials: sample vials, guides, charts ($100)
- Display materials for reception area ($50)
- Sanitation supplies ($50)
- Refreshments and palate cleansers ($100)

**Total Budget Request:** $600

## Crew

### Team Members
- **Jeff Hamm** (Project Lead, Chief Signal Operator)
- **Mikaela Holmes** (Signal Translator, Consent Coordinator)
- **[2-3 additional crew TBD]** (Broadcast Technicians, Reception Staff)

### Staffing
- 2-3 people during operating hours
- 1 managing training
- 1-2 facilitating broadcasts and reception
- Can operate in reduced mode with signage

### Prior Art
- Bring a Pheromone (Burning Man 2024)
- Infinite Butts
- The Cheese Museum
- Emergency Delivery Service

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

### Identity & Representation
Our crew includes members of marginalized communities. The piece celebrates body-to-body communication that exists outside systems of oppression.

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Physical access**: Multiple aperture heights, wheelchair-accessible layout
- **Sensory considerations**: Strong smells are part of the experience, disclosed upfront; alternative participation available
- **Body celebration**: All broadcasts are valid. All signals matter. No hierarchy of bodies or scents.
- **Inclusive language**: All bodies communicate, all identities welcome

### Access Needs
*To be documented as crew is finalized*

### Mentorship Program
Open to mentoring artists interested in theme-integrated interactive experiences.
