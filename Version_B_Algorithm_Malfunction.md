# Bring a Pheromone - VERSION B: ALGORITHM MALFUNCTION
## Room Service 2025 RAT Submission

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)
**Bring a Pheromone**
*(18 characters)*

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)
Our optimization algorithm was supposed to match people using The Mind's preferred data: photos, interests, compatibility scores. But something broke. Now it only works with armpits. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving. Come experience chemistry when the algorithm finally malfunctions correctly.

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)
Participants encounter a botanical structure with three circular apertures surrounded by branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three engagement modes:

**Self-Serve Malfunction (2pm-1am daily):** The broken algorithm lets you insert your armpit through one side while someone samples from the other. Rating cards available. Stay anonymous or reveal yourself—your choice.

**Sommelier Certification Training (staffed sessions):** Learn to analyze what the algorithm now prioritizes: name the armpit based on visible features, test moisture level, initial scent assessment, flavor profile analysis (nutty, earthy, robust, acidic), attractiveness rating, optional taste test. Receive certification and scent documentation.

**Pheromone Matching Protocol (staffed):** The algorithm's new method: two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden. Both sample each other's scent. Both indicate "match" or "no match." Compatible chemistry? Facilitators reveal identities for a date. No chemistry? Remain anonymous.

The system meant to optimize attraction through Mind-approved metrics broke beautifully—now it just lets bodies decide.

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)
Late-stage capitalism built algorithms to categorize, optimize, and commodify attraction. Dating apps reduced bodies to data points: swipe on photos, match by interests, optimize for compatibility scores. The Mind loved it—finally, attraction could be rational, predictable, controlled.

Then the algorithm malfunctioned. Now it only processes pheromones.

Suddenly all The Mind's categories are worthless. Age, gender, race, conventional attractiveness—the algorithm can't see any of it. Only scent remains. Only chemistry. Only what bodies have been trying to tell us all along before we let The Mind build systems to override our instincts.

This is what happens when bodies refuse to be optimized. When the system designed to make us ignore our gut feelings breaks down, and we're left with just... our guts. Our sweat glands. Our microbiomes talking to other microbiomes.

The Mind calls it a malfunction. The Body calls it liberation.

We're running the broken algorithm intentionally, proving that when you strip away The Mind's metrics for categorizing bodies, what emerges is more authentic than any optimization ever delivered.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)
This experience explores attraction through scent alone and involves unconventional body engagement, so consent, comfort, and safety are paramount:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains the experience before participation
- Verbal consent required for Matching Protocol experiences
- Participants can stop or opt out at any time
- For matching, both parties must consent before identities are revealed

**Inclusive Design:**
- Welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities
- No pressure to participate in any particular way—smell, be smelled, or observe
- Self-serve option available without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides support and structure

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact limited to armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private decompression space available nearby in Art Room
- Contact established with Art Safety team for concerns

**Body Positivity:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity and appreciation, never judgment
- All scents described using neutral flavor profile terminology (wine tasting style)
- Experience reframes typically stigmatized body parts as sites of authentic connection
- No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural scents are welcome
- Framing: bodies as sources of truth, not products to optimize

**If someone experiences difficulty, facilitators will:**
1. Immediately check in and offer to pause
2. Provide water and seating in our space
3. Listen without judgment to what's coming up
4. Offer to connect with Art Safety if needed
5. Follow up later in the event to ensure they're okay

The "algorithm malfunction" framing helps participants understand they're experiencing attraction outside conventional categorization—which can feel vulnerable, liberating, or both.

### Structure / Room Design
A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth adorned with branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three circular apertures function as anonymous armpit glory holes, allowing scent-based interaction between participants on opposite sides while remaining visually separated. The organic aesthetic suggests The Mind's rigid systems overtaken by the body's wild intelligence—the algorithm malfunctioned, and nature is reclaiming the space.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with body imagery—aligns with Room Service 2025 style guide

---

### Placement Preferences
1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Running Elbow Appreciation concurrently in Art Room. Both projects explore body-focused connection and unconventional attraction. Shared crew and scheduling. The intimate nature of pheromone-based matching benefits from a semi-private space where The Mind's surveillance feels less oppressive.

### When Active
- Self-serve: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed sessions: Variable, confirmed Saturday afternoon/evening

*This version frames the experience as a broken optimization system—satirizing how capitalism tries to commodify and rationalize attraction, then celebrates when bodies reject that programming.*
