## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name
**The Decategorization Station**
*(Bring a Pheromone)*

### Brief Synopsis
What happens when The Mind can't categorize bodies using its usual methods? Our armpit-focused installation forces participants to abandon visual categorization and discover connection through scent alone—the most primal form of chemistry. Featuring Scent Sommelier certification and pheromone-based blind dating.

### Describe the Participant's Journey

**The Challenge:**  
Participants arrive at a carnival-style booth that presents an absurd proposition: judge attraction based solely on armpit smell. Three circular apertures invite interaction while maintaining anonymity.

**Self-Directed Exploration (2pm-1am daily):**
1. Discover the booth and read consent/participation guidelines
2. Choose to be the smeller, the smelled, or both
3. Insert armpit into aperture from one side while another participant samples from opposite side
4. Use provided scent cards to document your analysis
5. Decide whether to reveal identity or remain anonymous
6. Leave with a new appreciation for olfactory attraction

**Guided Decategorization Training (Staffed sessions):**
Our Certified Scent Sommeliers guide participants through the systematic deconstruction of their usual body-categorization methods:

1. **Visual Deprivation:** Only the armpit is visible—no face, body, clothing, or other categorization cues
2. **Forced Re-categorization:** Name the armpit based on visual features alone (Old Man Whiskers, Glitterpit, 5pm Shadow)
3. **Sensory Analysis:** 
   - Moisture level assessment
   - Initial scent impression
   - Detailed flavor profiling (nuttiness, earthiness, sweetness, acidity)
   - Create visual chart of scent characteristics
4. **Instinct vs. Logic:** Rate attractiveness based purely on scent
5. **Optional Chemical Connection:** Taste test for the truly curious
6. **Documentation:** Record findings on scent slip to keep, share, or archive
7. **Certification:** Become a Scent Sommelier yourself

**Pheromone Matchmaking (Staffed sessions):**
1. Two participants consent to pheromone-based blind "dating"
2. Each inserts an armpit while remaining fully hidden
3. Both sample each other's natural scent
4. Independently decide: "sniff right" (interested) or "sniff left" (pass)
5. Facilitators check compatibility:
   - No match? Remain anonymous
   - Mutual match? Facilitators introduce you for further chemistry exploration
6. Test whether chemical compatibility translates to connection

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes?

**The Mind is obsessed with categorization.** It sorts bodies into neat boxes: attractive/unattractive, male/female, young/old, fit/unfit, my-type/not-my-type. This categorization happens so automatically that we rarely question it. But what if we removed every single data point The Mind uses to judge bodies?

**The Decategorization Station systematically strips away these inputs.** Without seeing someone's face, body, style, or demographic markers, participants must rely on the one sense that predates language and logic: smell. Suddenly, every category collapses. Gender becomes irrelevant. Conventional beauty standards evaporate. Age, race, body type—none of it registers. All that remains is pure chemical compatibility.

**This reveals the tension between immutable biology and malleable perception.** Our bodies produce pheromones—that's immutable. But what The Mind has learned to find "attractive" is entirely malleable, constructed by society, media, and conditioning. By removing learned responses and accessing instinctual attraction, we discover that:
- The same body can be "attractive" to our nose but wouldn't register visually (or vice versa)
- Our usual categories may have nothing to do with actual compatibility
- The armpit—typically hidden and stigmatized—can be a site of profound connection

**The armpit becomes a teacher.** This often-maligned body part houses unique bacterial flora that creates each person's signature scent. It's a liminal zone: not quite private, not quite public; not quite sexual, not quite platonic. It's where The Body's chemistry lives, undisguised by The Mind's aesthetics.

**By temporarily disabling The Mind's categorization system, we discover what The Body knew all along:** attraction is chemical, instinctual, and far more interesting than any category we could create. The experience doesn't just challenge how we categorize others—it forces us to recategorize ourselves. Am I the kind of person attracted to "Earthy Nutmeg" pit? Apparently yes. The Mind is confused. The Body is delighted.

**Through decategorization, we find truer embodiment.** When forced to experience ourselves and others as pure chemistry rather than sorted categories, we become more present in our actual bodies—not The Mind's idea of them.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences

This experience asks people to engage with bodies in unconventional ways, which may bring up discomfort, vulnerability, or unexpected feelings:

**Consent Architecture:**
- Clear pre-experience briefing about what's involved
- Explicit verbal consent for pheromone dating
- Continuous opportunity to pause or stop
- Identity reveal only happens with mutual consent
- All participation is optional—observing is valid too

**Safe Container:**
- Facilitators trained in recognizing and responding to distress
- Art Room location provides semi-private, contained space
- Decompression area available nearby
- Connection to Art Safety team for escalation if needed

**Inclusive Language & Approach:**
- All bodies, scents, and chemistry are welcomed without judgment
- Terminology is curious and appreciative, never critical
- No pressure to be "prepared" or "acceptable"—all natural scents celebrated
- Experience designed for all genders, identities, and orientations

**Support Protocol:**
If someone is struggling, we will:
1. Immediately check in with compassion
2. Pause experience and offer space/water
3. Listen to what's coming up without judgment
4. Provide resources (Art Safety contact, quiet space)
5. Follow up later to ensure wellbeing

**Body Sovereignty:**
The experience emphasizes that participants maintain full agency over their bodies throughout. They choose how to participate, when to stop, and whether to reveal identity.

### Participant Experience Type
- **Guided experience** (Sommelier training & matchmaking)
- **Passive interactivity** (self-serve exploration)

### Interaction/Tone/Purpose
- Investigative & Curious
- Silly & Absurd
- Playful & Flirtatious

### Safety

**Food or drink served:** No

**Content rating:** Non-sexual sensory exploration focused on scent and chemistry
