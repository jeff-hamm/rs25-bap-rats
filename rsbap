## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name
**Bring a Pheromone**

### Brief Synopsis
A perspiration appreciation installation that allows us to experience each other, and find possible connection, through interaction with anonymized armpits alone. We offer Scent Sommelier certification training and pheromone-based blind dating using our portable armpit glory-hole booth.

### Describe the Participant's Journey

The Bring a Pheromone booth offers several ways for participants to engage with our axillae anonymization apertures (armpit glory-holes) as either the smeller, the smell-y, or both:

**Self-Serve Exploration (Available 2pm-1am daily):**
- Participants discover the colorful carnival-style booth with three circular openings
- They can insert their armpit from one side while someone else samples from the other
- Scent cards and rating forms are available for self-guided analysis
- Participants can remain anonymous or reveal themselves after the experience

**Scent Sommelier Training (Staffed sessions, especially Saturday afternoon/evening):**
- Trained facilitators guide participants through a Wine & Cheese style analysis of an unseen stranger's armpit
- **Name the armpit:** Using Rorschach-type analysis of visible features (names range from "Old Man Whiskers" to "5pm Shadow" to "Glitterpit")
- **Sample moisture level:** Finger-tip test of dampness
- **Initial whiff:** Nostril-to-pit contact for overall scent rating
- **Flavor profile analysis:** Delve into characteristics (nuttiness, robustness, acidity, earthiness) and plot on a visualization chart
- **Attractiveness rating:** Rate the appeal of the scent
- **Optional taste test:** For the adventurous
- All data is recorded on scent slips that participants can keep, give to the pit owner, or leave with us
- Participants can become certified Scent Sommeliers and guide others

**Pheromone Dating (Staffed sessions):**
- Two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides of the booth, remaining otherwise hidden
- Both sample each other's scent
- Choose to "sniff right" or "sniff left" to indicate interest
- If smells aren't compatible, they remain anonymous
- If olfactory chemistry aligns, facilitators send them off on a date to explore their connection

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes?

In our pragmatic and visually focused world, we've lost touch with our instinctual modes of attraction. We categorize potential partners based on superficial characteristics dictated by our logical brains in response to socially imposed norms. **The Mind loves to organize**: this body is "attractive," that one is "not my type," this person fits my checklist. But what happens when we strip away everything The Mind uses to categorize bodies?

**Bring a Pheromone forces radical re-categorization.** Without seeing faces, bodies, or presentation, participants must rely purely on scent—one of our most primal, instinctual senses. Suddenly, the categories collapse. Gender, race, age, conventional attractiveness—none of it matters when all you have is an armpit.

**Our bodies become both immutable and malleable.** We all have armpits—that's immutable biology. But the scent produced by each unique microbiome is as individual as a fingerprint. Some armpits smell nutty, some earthy, some sweet. The experience reveals that while we share basic anatomy (immutable), our individual expressions of that anatomy are wildly diverse (malleable).

**This is embodiment through disembodiment.** By isolating one transgressive zone of our biology and making it the sole point of connection, we bypass societal conditioning about bodies. Participants often report feeling *more* present in their bodies after experiencing connection through such an unexpected, stigmatized body part. The armpit—typically hidden, often maligned—becomes a site of possibility, attraction, and authentic chemistry.

**The Mind would absolutely hate this.** It can't categorize based on its usual metrics. All those rules about who we "should" be attracted to become useless. What emerges instead is pure chemical compatibility, the kind of attraction that exists before language, before social norms, before The Mind learned to judge bodies.

Through sensory deconstruction, we reconstruct perception. Through controlled anonymity, we discover authentic embodiment.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences

This experience involves temporarily engaging with bodies in an unconventional way and exploring attraction/chemistry, so clear communication, consent, and comfort are central to our design:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains what the experience entails before participation
- Verbal consent is obtained for Pheromone Dating experiences
- Participants are reminded they can stop or opt out at any time
- For dating experiences, both parties must explicitly consent before identities are revealed

**Inclusive Design:**
- Experience welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities
- No pressure to participate in any particular way—people can smell, be smelled, or just observe
- Self-serve option allows participation without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides support and structure for those who want it

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact is limited to the armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators are trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private space available nearby if someone needs to decompress
- Contact with Art Safety team established for any concerns

**Body Positivity:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity and appreciation, never judgment
- All scents are described using neutral flavor profile terminology (like wine tasting)
- Experience reframes typically stigmatized body parts as sites of connection and beauty
- No requirement to have "prepared" armpits—all natural scents welcome

If someone is having a challenging experience, facilitators will:
1. Immediately check in and offer to pause the experience
2. Provide water and a place to sit in our Art Room
3. Listen without judgment to what's coming up for them
4. Offer to connect them with Art Safety if needed
5. Follow up later in the event to ensure they're okay

### Participant Experience Type
**Guided experience** (staffed sessions)  
**Passive interactivity** (self-serve hours)

### Interaction/Tone/Purpose
- Silly & Absurd
- Playful & Flirtatious  
- Investigative & Curious

### Safety

**Do you plan to serve any food or drink?**  
No

**Content Rating:**  
Non-sexual, body-positive, sensory exploration

## SECTION 3 - Logistics & Production

### Placement
**Location Preference:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Why this location?**  
We're also running Elbow Appreciation in the Art Room, and there's great synergy between these body-part-focused experiences. The Art Room provides a semi-private, intimate space perfect for both guided sommeliere training and the vulnerable exploration of pheromone dating.

### Physical Description
- **Booth Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep (packs flat for checked luggage!)
- **Design:** Carnival-style facade with "ARMPIT SMELLING BOOTH" and "BRING A PHEROMONE" signage in vintage circus lettering
- **Color Scheme:** Red, white, and blue with decorative drapery
- **Features:** Three circular apertures (glory-holes) for armpit insertion, allowing anonymous interaction between participants on opposite sides
- **Footprint:** Will utilize surrounding Art Room space for queue/observation area (approximately 8-10 feet total)

### Operating Hours
- **Self-serve availability:** 2pm - 1am daily (Thursday through Sunday)
- **Staffed sessions:** Variable schedule, confirmed for Saturday afternoon/evening (overlapping with Elbow Appreciation)
- **24-hour operation:** No (overnight rest for our armpits)

### Materials & Setup
- Portable booth structure (packs flat)
- Scent Sommelier cards and clipboards
- Pens/markers for flavor profile documentation
- Signage explaining consent and how to participate
- Decorative fabric, LED lighting for nighttime visibility
- Sanitizing wipes for between-participant cleaning
