## Project Overview

### Description
The Mind wants to swipe through profiles and make rational choices. Your body just wants to smell someone's pits. We're the anti-algorithm‚Äîa matchmaking service where your nose gets to opt out of what your brain thinks it wants. Three carnival glory holes. Zero questionnaires. Just you, someone's armpit, and the chemicals doing deals your consciousness isn't invited to.

### Experience Journey

1. **Algorithm Intake (Parody)** ‚Äì Fill out an absurdly detailed intake form parodying dating apps: "Describe your ideal partner's credit score" and "How well-categorized are your feelings?" Then we cross it all out and say "your body doesn't care about any of this."
2. **Palate Training** ‚Äì Brief intro to pheromone detection using sample vials. Learn to notice when your body responds vs. when your brain is making up stories.
3. **The Blind Sniff** ‚Äì Stick your nose (or your pit) through one of three apertures. No photos, no bios, no strategic lighting. Just chemical signals your thinking brain can't fake or filter.
4. **Body Betrays Brain** ‚Äì Discover that your body's into someone your brain would never have swiped right on. Or your body's completely uninterested in your "type." Welcome to the revolution.
5. **Matchmaking Chaos** ‚Äì For those interested, we track whose bodies responded to each other (regardless of what their brains think). Facilitate introductions if there's mutual physical interest.

### Thematic Connection

The Mind has colonized dating. Swipe apps, compatibility algorithms, detailed profiles‚Äîit's all the Mind trying to make a rational decision about something fundamentally irrational. Your body knows in three seconds of smelling someone whether it's interested. Your brain needs six dates and a pros/cons list.

This is bodily autonomy versus mental control in its most literal form. The Mind wants to categorize potential partners: educated/uneducated, successful/unsuccessful, acceptable/unacceptable. Your pheromone receptors don't have access to LinkedIn. They're reading immune system compatibility, genetic diversity, and microbiome harmony. They're making deals your consciousness isn't invited to.

Under capitalism, we're taught to optimize everything, including intimacy. Choose the "right" partner based on measurable qualities. Improve yourself to attract "better" matches. Treat bodies as commodities to be marketed. The Mind *loves* this system because it's all about control and categorization.

But put your nose near someone's armpit and watch that whole system collapse. Attraction doesn't happen in your prefrontal cortex. It happens in chemical receptors, in gut responses, in parts of you that don't give a fuck about your five-year plan.

The microbiome spreading across The Body is teaching body parts to trust each other more than they trust the Mind's filing system. Your gut is trying to talk to someone else's gut. Your immune system is running compatibility checks. Your bacteria are introducing themselves to their bacteria. All of this is happening whether your brain approves or not.

This piece is about surrendering control. About discovering that your body has preferences your mind doesn't understand. About finding out that the person your body wants might not match any of the categories your brain insisted on. That's not a bug. That's your body refusing to be a commodity, refusing to be optimized, refusing to let the Mind categorize something this important.

## Participant Support & Safety

### Supporting Participants
Smell-based attraction is deeply personal and can bring up unexpected reactions. We address this through:

- **Consent as practice**: Multiple check-ins, clear descriptions of what's happening, easy opt-outs
- **Humor defuses tension**: The "anti-dating app" parody framing helps people laugh through vulnerability
- **No judgment container**: We celebrate ALL responses. Body says no? Valid. Body says yes to someone unexpected? Valid. Body's confused? Also valid.
- **Diverse bodies celebrated**: This explicitly rejects narrow beauty/desirability standards. All bodies and smells are welcome.
- **Trained facilitators**: Crew experienced with intimacy-adjacent interactive art and consent practices
- **Decompression space**: Area to process if someone has an unexpected reaction
- **Privacy options**: Can participate without matchmaking, can smell without being smelled, can observe without sniffing
- **LGBTQ+ friendly**: All orientations and gender identities welcome. Your body knows what it wants.

This is not sexual content, but it IS intimate. We're clear about that distinction and train our crew accordingly.

### Experience Type
**Guided Experience**

### Safety Considerations
- **Food/Drink:** ‚úÖ Yes, palate cleansers and refreshments
- **Content Rating:** Non-sexual content (intimate but not sexual)

## Logistics

### Placement
**Location:** Art Room (Static installation)

**Footprint:**
- Booth: 4ft √ó 6ft

**Hours:** Saturday 2pm-1am (prime matchmaking time), plus Friday/Sunday sessions

### Structure Description

**The Anti-Algorithm Booth:** 50" √ó 24" portable carnival structure with three apertures at different heights. Decorated as a parody of tech startup aesthetics but overgrown with plants:
- Clean lines and "minimalist" design being invaded by baroque botanical elements
- Crossed-out app interface mockups with "ERROR: BODY OVERRIDE" messages
- Gold circuit-board patterns tangled with green vines (fire-code compliant live plants)
- Apertures labeled: "Bypass Brain Here," "Direct Body Access," "No Filters"

**The Intake Station:** Parody dating app questionnaire on clipboards with ridiculous questions, all crossed out. Sign says "Your body doesn't care about any of this."

**The Lounge:** Space for people who got matched to actually meet each other face-to-face (if both want to). Comfortable seating, low lighting, anti-algorithm propaganda art.

**Aesthetic:** Satirical tech-bro minimalism being reclaimed by botanical chaos. Botanical surrealism meets Black Mirror parody.
