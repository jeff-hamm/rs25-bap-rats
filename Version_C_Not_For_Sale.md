# Bring a Pheromone - VERSION C: NOT FOR SALE

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)
**Bring a Pheromone**
*(18 characters)*

---

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)
Late-stage capitalism wants to turn your body into a commodity: track it, optimize it, sell it back to you as "wellness." Your sweat glands didn't get the memo. Come experience what happens when bodies refuse to perform as products and insist on being gloriously, chemically, authentically themselves.

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)
Participants find a botanical structure with three circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three ways to engage:

**Self-Serve Refusal (2pm-1am daily):** Insert your armpit through one opening while someone samples from the other side. No metrics, no optimization, no performance—just bodies being bodies. Rating cards available. Choose anonymity or revelation.

**Scent Sommelier Certification (staffed sessions):** Facilitators guide participants through appreciating what can't be commodified: name the armpit based on visible features, assess moisture, initial scent impression, flavor profile mapping (earthy, nutty, acidic, robust), attractiveness rating, optional taste test. Receive certification and scent documentation celebrating your unrepeatable microbiome.

**Pheromone Connection (staffed):** Two consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden. Both sample. Both decide if chemistry exists outside capitalism's metrics. If connection aligns, facilitators reveal identities for a date. If not, anonymity preserved.

Experience bodies as ecosystems, not economies. Your sweat glands are not a product line.

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)
Since Descartes declared bodies machines, capitalism has been trying to turn us into products. Optimize your body, track your body, perform your body, sell your body back to yourself as "self-care" and "wellness." Your worth is measured in productivity, your attractiveness ranked by algorithms, your chemistry reduced to data points.

But your sweat glands refuse to participate in the economy. They're not for sale. They're not optimizing. They're just broadcasting your unrepeatable microbiome to anyone close enough to smell.

Bring a Pheromone celebrates what can't be commodified. When you strip away everything The Mind uses to categorize bodies as products (appearance, metrics, performance), what remains is the stubborn, gloriously unmarketable truth of your chemical self.

This is bodies insisting on their non-commercial nature. Your pheromones don't care about your personal brand. Your armpit's not trying to disrupt an industry. You're just... you. Messy, specific, authentic, impossible to optimize.

The Mind wants to sell you on who you should be. Your body already knows who you are—and it's not for sale.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)
This experience involves unconventional body engagement and explores attraction through scent, so consent, safety, and body-positivity are foundational:

**Consent & Communication:**
- Clear signage explains the experience before participation
- Verbal consent required for Connection experiences
- Participants can stop or opt out anytime
- For connections, both parties must consent before identities reveal

**Inclusive Design:**
- Welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities
- No pressure to participate in any specific way—smell, be smelled, or observe
- Self-serve option available without facilitator interaction
- Guided option provides structure for those wanting support

**Boundaries & Safety:**
- Physical contact limited to armpit area only, separated by booth structure
- Facilitators trained to recognize discomfort and offer exit strategies
- Private decompression space available nearby in Art Room
- Contact established with Art Safety team for concerns

**Body Positivity:**
- Language emphasizes curiosity, appreciation, celebration—never judgment
- All scents described using neutral flavor terminology (wine tasting style)
- Experience reframes stigmatized body parts as sites of authentic connection
- No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural scents welcome
- Anti-capitalist framing: bodies are ecosystems, not products to perform or perfect

**If someone struggles, facilitators will:**
1. Immediately check in and offer to pause
2. Provide water and seating
3. Listen without judgment to what's arising
4. Offer Art Safety connection if needed
5. Follow up later to ensure wellbeing

For people whose bodies have been commodified or judged harshly, celebrating armpit scent as unmarketable authenticity can be powerful—and vulnerable. We approach this with care and compassion.

### Structure / Room Design
A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth adorned with branches, vines, and surreal body art (lips, eyes). Three circular apertures serve as anonymous armpit glory holes, enabling scent-based interaction between participants on opposite sides while remaining visually separated. The organic aesthetic evokes the body's interior ecosystem—wild, impossible to commodify, resistant to The Mind's attempts at optimization and control.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with body imagery—aligns with Room Service 2025 style guide

---

### Placement Preferences
1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Running Elbow Appreciation concurrently in Art Room. Both projects celebrate unconventional body parts and resist commodification of bodies. Shared crew and scheduling. The intimate, anti-performance nature of pheromone connection benefits from a space that feels less surveilled, more authentic.

---

### When Active
- Self-serve: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed sessions: Variable, confirmed Saturday afternoon/evening
