# Room Service 2025 - Bring a Pheromone Proposals

Welcome! Multiple variations on the **Bring a Pheromone** installation for Room Service 2025, organized by creative development rounds.

## Event Theme

**"The Body vs. The Mind: An Impossible Categorization"**

## The Core Concept

Three carnival-style glory holes. One portable booth. An army of trained Scent Sommeliers. Your armpit has stories to tell, and we're here to help people listen.

---

## üìã Initial Options (Where It All Started)

The first three approaches, ranging from traditional RAT format to absurdist research study.

### Option 1: Bring a Pheromone (Traditional RAT)

Comprehensive traditional format covering all bases: training, matchmaking, certification, community building.

### Option 2: Pheromone Decategorization Lab

Theme-focused exploration of how pheromones resist categorization, with emphasis on bodily autonomy.

### Option 3: The Armpit Glory Hole Research Study

Absurdist "research study" framing with IRB-style documentation and carnival booth methodology.

## ‚≠ê Metatheme but Silly Options (Metatheme + Aesthetic Integration)

These options deeply engage with the North Star question, Sonya Renee Taylor, Descartes critique, and body commodification while staying playful and incorporating specific Style Guide aesthetics.

### Option 1: The Body Refuses (An Armpit Manifesto)

Descartes said your body is a machine. Capitalism turned it into a product. Your armpit disagrees. **Silly-serious exploration of bodily autonomy through Scent Sommelier training, pheromone matchmaking, and Victorian specimen cabinet aesthetics being invaded by botanical chaos.**

- [View Full Proposal](Final_Option_1_Liberation_Project.html)

### Option 2: Bodies Are Impossible to Categorize (We Have Receipts)

Society spent centuries sorting bodies into categories. Then someone invented armpit-sniffing as research methodology and the whole system collapsed. **We're collecting evidence of that collapse with carnival booth glory holes, certification, and a growing archive of categorical failure.**

- [View Full Proposal](Final_Option_2_Impossible_to_Categorize.html)

### Option 3: Your Body Is Not For Sale (But Your Armpit Might Have Opinions)

Late-stage capitalism wants to turn your body into a commodity. Your sweat glands didn't get the memo. **Pop-up research station documenting what happens when bodies communicate in languages that can't be standardized, productized, or reduced to algorithms. The Commodity Exchange Floor where products go to die and bodies get to be free.**

## üìñ Narrative Options (Bold Thematic Reframings)

Creative approaches that reimagine the concept through strong narrative frames that integrate deeply with RS25's themes.

### Option 1: The Pheromone Underground

Your armpits are sending secret messages the Mind can't intercept. We're a clandestine station training Scent Sommeliers to read the chemical rebellion. **Pheromones as encrypted resistance communication.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_1_Pheromone_Underground.html)

### Option 2: The Armpit Index - A Comprehensive Failure of Taxonomy

The Mind tried to categorize every smell in The Body. It failed spectacularly. We're documenting that failure through Victorian naturalist aesthetics and gorgeously useless classification systems. **Every armpit is proof that some things refuse to be filed away.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_2_The_Armpit_Index.html)

### Option 3: The Gut Whispers - Messages from Exile

The Gut has been in exile, but it's broadcasting through your armpits. We're a listening station decoding chemical signals the Mind can't intercept. **Direct integration with Friday's narrative about finding the exiled Gut.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_3_The_Gut_Whispers.html)

### Option 4: Body Knows Best - The Anti-Dating App

The Mind wants to swipe through profiles and make rational choices. Your body just wants to smell someone's pits. We're the anti-algorithm where your nose opts out of what your brain thinks it wants. **Zero questionnaires. Just pheromones and bodily autonomy.**

## üåâ BRIDGE Options (Medium Creative Integration)

Medium creative approaches that bridge traditional RAT structure with stronger thematic integration‚Äîaccessible hooks with meaningful depth.

### Option A: The Body's Filing Cabinet

The Mind tried to organize every body signal into neat categories. We're the overworked archivists documenting the glorious failure of bureaucratic body control. **Mid-century office aesthetics being invaded by botanical chaos.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_A_Bodys_Filing_Cabinet.html)

### Option B: Scent Signal Station

Your body parts want to talk to each other, but the Mind keeps blocking the signals. We're amplifying the conversations your body is already having on frequencies the Mind can't monitor. **Body-to-body communication made visible.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_B_Scent_Signal_Station.html)

### Option C: The Compatibility Algorithm (System Malfunction)

Our matchmaking algorithm was supposed to use rational criteria. It malfunctioned. Now it only works with armpits. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving. **Tech startup aesthetic being destroyed by botanical rebellion.**

## üìã INITIAL Options

The first three approaches, ranging from traditional RAT format to absurdist research study‚Äîwhere it all started.

### Option A: Bring a Pheromone (Classic)

- [View Full Proposal](Bring_a_Pheromone_RAT_2025.html)

### Option B: The Decategorization Station

Theme-focused on how The Mind categorizes vs. how The Body knows, with emphasis on RS25's impossible categorization theme.

- [View Full Proposal](Pheromone_Decategorization_RAT_Option2.html)

### Option C: The Armpit Glory-Hole (Research Study)

Absurdist "research study" framing with tongue-in-cheek scientific language and peer-review methodology.
