# Room Service 2025 - Bring a Pheromone Proposals

Welcome! Multiple variations on the **Bring a Pheromone** installation for Room Service 2025, organized by creative development rounds.

## Event Theme

**"The Body vs. The Mind: An Impossible Categorization"**

## The Core Concept

Three carnival-style glory holes. One portable booth. An army of trained Scent Sommeliers. Your armpit has stories to tell, and we're here to help people listen.

---

## üé® CREATIVE Options (Bold Thematic Reframings)

These options take the core experience and push it in dramatically different thematic directions, deeply integrating with RS25's specific narrative and philosophical themes.

### Option 1: The Pheromone Underground

Your armpits are sending secret messages the Mind can't intercept. We're a clandestine station training Scent Sommeliers to read the chemical rebellion. **Pheromones as encrypted resistance communication.**

### Option 2: The Armpit Index - A Comprehensive Failure of Taxonomy

The Mind tried to categorize every smell in The Body. It failed spectacularly. We're documenting that failure through Victorian naturalist aesthetics and gorgeously useless classification systems. **Every armpit is proof that some things refuse to be filed away.**

### Option 3: The Gut Whispers - Messages from Exile

The Gut has been in exile, but it's broadcasting through your armpits. We're a listening station decoding chemical signals the Mind can't intercept. **Direct integration with Friday's narrative about finding the exiled Gut.**

### Option 4: Body Knows Best - The Anti-Dating App

The Mind wants to swipe through profiles and make rational choices. Your body just wants to smell someone's pits. We're the anti-algorithm where your nose opts out of what your brain thinks it wants. **Zero questionnaires. Just pheromones and bodily autonomy.**

## üìù ROUND 2 Options (Medium Creative Integration)

These bridge traditional RAT structure with stronger RS25 theme integration‚Äîaccessible hooks with meaningful thematic depth.

### Round 2-A: The Body's Filing Cabinet

The Mind tried to organize every body signal into neat categories. We're the overworked archivists documenting the glorious failure of bureaucratic body control. **Mid-century office aesthetics being invaded by botanical chaos.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_A_Bodys_Filing_Cabinet.html)

### Round 2-B: Scent Signal Station

Your body parts want to talk to each other, but the Mind keeps blocking the signals. We're amplifying the conversations your body is already having on frequencies the Mind can't monitor. **Body-to-body communication made visible.**

### Round 2-C: The Compatibility Algorithm (System Malfunction)

Our matchmaking algorithm was supposed to use rational criteria. It malfunctioned. Now it only works with armpits. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving. **Tech startup aesthetic being destroyed by botanical rebellion.**

### Round 1-C: The Armpit Glory-Hole (Research Study)

Absurdist "research study" framing with tongue-in-cheek scientific language and peer-review methodology.
