# Room Service 2025 - Bring a Pheromone Proposals

Welcome! These are four bold thematic approaches to the **Bring a Pheromone** installation for Room Service 2025.

## Event Theme
**"The Body vs. The Mind: An Impossible Categorization"**

## The Core Concept

Three carnival-style glory holes. One portable booth. An army of trained Scent Sommeliers. Your armpit has stories to tell, and we're here to help people listen.

## Proposal Options

### Option 1: The Pheromone Underground
Your armpits are sending secret messages the Mind can't intercept. We're a clandestine station training Scent Sommeliers to read the chemical rebellion. **Pheromones as encrypted resistance communication.**

### Option 2: The Armpit Index - A Comprehensive Failure of Taxonomy
The Mind tried to categorize every smell in The Body. It failed spectacularly. We're documenting that failure through Victorian naturalist aesthetics and gorgeously useless classification systems. **Every armpit is proof that some things refuse to be filed away.**

### Option 3: The Gut Whispers - Messages from Exile
The Gut has been in exile, but it's broadcasting through your armpits. We're a listening station decoding chemical signals the Mind can't intercept. **Direct integration with Friday's narrative about finding the exiled Gut.**

### Option 4: Body Knows Best - The Anti-Dating App
The Mind wants to swipe through profiles and make rational choices. Your body just wants to smell someone's pits. We're the anti-algorithm where your nose opts out of what your brain thinks it wants. **Zero questionnaires. Just pheromones and bodily autonomy.**

*These proposals represent different narrative and thematic approaches to the same core interactive experience. Each connects to the RS25 theme "The Body vs. The Mind: An Impossible Categorization" through distinct lenses: resistance networks, failed taxonomy, narrative integration, and anti-capitalist dating.*
