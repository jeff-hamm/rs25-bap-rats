Bodies know how to talk to bodies, gut to nose, sweat to brain, flora to flora. Train as a certified Smelli√©r, surrender your scent to the armpit glory hole, and sniff right on chemical connection.**Features:**

- Pheromone Matchmaking sessions

#### What to Expect- Scent Smelli√©r Certification program

- Surreal artistic booth design with natural imagery

**Pheromone Matchmaking**- Self-service and guided experiences

- Insert your armpit through the booth, remaining anonymous

- Smell each other simultaneously- [View Full Project Details](Bring_a_Pheromone.html)

- Press the button if there's chemistry

- Compatible? We reveal identities and suggest date activities!---

- Not a match? Anonymity preserved

### The Bound Banquet (Elbow Appreciation) üåø

**Scent Smelli√©r Certification**

- Learn to assess moisture, map flavor profiles, and identify scent notes**We celebrate connection by giving up control.**

- Keep your scent journal or contribute to our pheromone files

- Earn your official Smelli√©r certificationArms splinted with branches, guests become plant-person hybrids who can't feed themselves. Everything becomes a team effort‚Äîan experiment in cooperation, care, and collective awkwardness. Together, we learn that being bound can be surprisingly freeing.



#### The Experience**Features:**

A custom-built modular booth (~5' x 5') featuring surreal collage artwork with orange geometric forms, natural imagery (ferns, flowers, moths), and prominent eye motifs against a black background. The interior creates an intimate sensory environment for exploring pheromonal communication and altered perception.- Communal meal with splinted elbows

- Collaborative games and activities

**[View Full Project Details ‚Üí](Bring_a_Pheromone.html)**- Exploration of bodily autonomy and interdependence

- Elbow appreciation ceremony

### üåø The Bound Banquet (Elbow Appreciation)

---

**We celebrate connection by giving up control.**

### Signal Station Version

Arms splinted with branches, guests become plant-person hybrids who can't feed themselves. Everything becomes a team effort‚Äîan experiment in cooperation, care, and collective awkwardness. Together, we learn that being bound can be surprisingly freeing.

Bodies communicating around The Mind's attempts at control‚Äîa signal station metaphor for pheromone broadcasting.

#### What to Expect

- [View Full Proposal](Version_A_Signal_Station.html)

1. **Consent** ‚Äì Brief explanation and consent to participate

2. **Splinting** ‚Äì Elbows gently bound with branches, locking arms straight### Algorithm Malfunction Version

3. **Activities** ‚Äì Share a communal meal and play games while splinted. Simple things like passing food or picking up a cup become hilariously difficult, requiring teamwork and creativity

4. **Unbinding & Elbow Appreciation** ‚Äì Splints come off and the relief is instant. Everyone tries basic movements again and shares what they missed mostA matchmaking system designed to commodify attraction gets hacked by the microbiome‚Äîcapitalism satirized through technology failure.



#### The Concept- [View Full Proposal](Version_B_Algorithm_Malfunction.html)

The Bound Banquet is about learning what your body does by temporarily losing it. You can't think or control your way through dinner when your arms don't bend. What happens instead is awkward, collaborative, and weirdly freeing. Your elbows become teachers about what's immutable (we all need to eat, we all have joints) and what's malleable (how we care for each other, who gets to feed and be fed).

### Not For Sale Version

**[View Full Project Details ‚Üí](Bound_Banquet.html)**

Bodies refusing commodification, celebrating the unmarketable authenticity of pheromones that won't perform as products.

---## üìã Initial Options (Where It All Started)



## üìú Legacy: Bring a Pheromone at Burning ManThe first three approaches, ranging from traditional RAT format to absurdist research study.



This isn't our first rodeo! Bring a Pheromone has been delighting participants since 2013.### Option 1: Bring a Pheromone (Traditional RAT)



![Original Booth at Burning Man](images/old_booth.jpg)Comprehensive traditional format covering all bases: training, matchmaking, certification, community building.

*The iconic carnival-style armpit booth at Burning Man 2015-2018*

- [View Full Proposal](Bring_a_Pheromone_RAT_2025.html)

**Previous Burning Man Years:** 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018

### Option 2: Pheromone Decategorization Lab

**Notable Press Coverage:**

- Featured in Burning Man's Jack Rabbit SpeaksTheme-focused exploration of how pheromones resist categorization, with emphasis on bodily autonomy.

- Buzzfeed's "53 Things I Learned at Burning Man"

- Multiple blogs and playa guides- [View Full Proposal](Pheromone_Decategorization_RAT_Option2.html)



**The Legacy:** Thousands of armpits sniffed, hundreds of Scent Sommeliers certified, countless "Oh my god, is that an armpit-smelling booth??" reactions, and at least a few lasting connections made through the power of pheromones.### Option 3: The Armpit Glory Hole Research Study



---Absurdist "research study" framing with IRB-style documentation and carnival booth methodology.

## ‚≠ê Metatheme but Silly Options (Metatheme + Aesthetic Integration)

These options deeply engage with the North Star question, Sonya Renee Taylor, Descartes critique, and body commodification while staying playful and incorporating specific Style Guide aesthetics.

### Option 1: The Body Refuses (An Armpit Manifesto)

Descartes said your body is a machine. Capitalism turned it into a product. Your armpit disagrees. **Silly-serious exploration of bodily autonomy through Scent Sommelier training, pheromone matchmaking, and Victorian specimen cabinet aesthetics being invaded by botanical chaos.**

- [View Full Proposal](Final_Option_1_Liberation_Project.html)

### Option 2: Bodies Are Impossible to Categorize (We Have Receipts)

Society spent centuries sorting bodies into categories. Then someone invented armpit-sniffing as research methodology and the whole system collapsed. **We're collecting evidence of that collapse with carnival booth glory holes, certification, and a growing archive of categorical failure.**

- [View Full Proposal](Final_Option_2_Impossible_to_Categorize.html)

### Option 3: Your Body Is Not For Sale (But Your Armpit Might Have Opinions)

Late-stage capitalism wants to turn your body into a commodity. Your sweat glands didn't get the memo. **Pop-up research station documenting what happens when bodies communicate in languages that can't be standardized, productized, or reduced to algorithms. The Commodity Exchange Floor where products go to die and bodies get to be free.**

- [View Full Proposal](Final_Option_3_Body_Commodity_Exchange.html)

---

## üìñ Narrative Options (Bold Thematic Reframings)

Creative approaches that reimagine the concept through strong narrative frames that integrate deeply with RS25's themes.

### Option 1: The Pheromone Underground

Your armpits are sending secret messages the Mind can't intercept. We're a clandestine station training Scent Sommeliers to read the chemical rebellion. **Pheromones as encrypted resistance communication.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_1_Pheromone_Underground.html)

### Option 2: The Armpit Index - A Comprehensive Failure of Taxonomy

The Mind tried to categorize every smell in The Body. It failed spectacularly. We're documenting that failure through Victorian naturalist aesthetics and gorgeously useless classification systems. **Every armpit is proof that some things refuse to be filed away.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_2_The_Armpit_Index.html)

### Option 3: The Gut Whispers - Messages from Exile

The Gut has been in exile, but it's broadcasting through your armpits. We're a listening station decoding chemical signals the Mind can't intercept. **Direct integration with Friday's narrative about finding the exiled Gut.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_3_The_Gut_Whispers.html)

### Option 4: Body Knows Best - The Anti-Dating App

The Mind wants to swipe through profiles and make rational choices. Your body just wants to smell someone's pits. We're the anti-algorithm where your nose opts out of what your brain thinks it wants. **Zero questionnaires. Just pheromones and bodily autonomy.**

- [View Full Proposal](Option_4_Body_Knows_Best.html)

## üåâ BRIDGE Options (Medium Creative Integration)

Medium creative approaches that bridge traditional RAT structure with stronger thematic integration‚Äîaccessible hooks with meaningful depth.

### Option A: The Body's Filing Cabinet

The Mind tried to organize every body signal into neat categories. We're the overworked archivists documenting the glorious failure of bureaucratic body control. **Mid-century office aesthetics being invaded by botanical chaos.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_A_Bodys_Filing_Cabinet.html)

### Option B: Scent Signal Station

Your body parts want to talk to each other, but the Mind keeps blocking the signals. We're amplifying the conversations your body is already having on frequencies the Mind can't monitor. **Body-to-body communication made visible.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_B_Scent_Signal_Station.html)

### Option C: The Compatibility Algorithm (System Malfunction)

Our matchmaking algorithm was supposed to use rational criteria. It malfunctioned. Now it only works with armpits. The Mind is furious. The Body is thriving. **Tech startup aesthetic being destroyed by botanical rebellion.**

- [View Full Proposal](Round2_Option_C_Algorithm_Malfunction.html)
