# ðŸ‘ƒ Organic Chemistry

***Train as a certified SmelliÃ©r, surrender your scent to the armpit glory hole, and sniff right on chemical connection.***

**[View Full Project Details â†’](Organic_Chemistry_Consulting.html)**

The Mind wants to quantify attraction with algorithms. Your microbiome hasn't gotten the memo. Bodies know how to talk to bodies, gut to nose, sweat to brain, flora to flora. Train as a certified SmelliÃ©r, surrender your scent to the armpit glory hole, and sniff right on chemical connection.

### The Concept

People discover chemistry with humans they'd never consider, revealing how malleable their "type" actually was. Journaling creates space to notice signals without immediately sorting themâ€”embodied awareness instead of overthinking.

### Experience

Participants find a booth with two circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and disembodied human features. Self-service and staffed sessions available, including during our Pheromone Happy Hour event.

#### **Pheromone Matchmaking**

1. Consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden
2. Both smell each other simultaneously
3. Each are given a button to indicate if they match
4. Compatible chemistry? Facilitators reveal identities and suggest date activities!
5. Incompatible? Anonymity preserved

#### **Scent SmelliÃ©r Certification**

1. Hidden participants insert armpits through booth openings and others sample from the outside
2. Self-service or guided by facilitator participants learn to:
   - Name the armpit by visible features
   - Assess moisture
   - Map scent impression and flavor profile (earthy, nutty, acidic, floral)
   - Optional taste test and much more!
3. Keep your scent journal, gift it to the pit owner, or contribute it to our pheromone files

# ðŸŒ¿ The Bound Banquet (Elbow Appreciation)

***We celebrate connection by giving up control.***

**[View Full Project Details â†’](Bound_Banquet.html)**

Arms splinted with branches, guests become plant-person hybrids who can't feed themselves. Everything becomes a team effortâ€”an experiment in cooperation, care, and collective awkwardness. Together, we learn that being bound can be surprisingly freeing.

### Experience

* **Splinting** â€“ Elbows gently bound with branches, locking arms straight
* **Activities** â€“ Share a communal meal and play games while splinted. Simple things like passing food or picking up a cup become hilariously difficult, requiring teamwork and creativity
* **Unbinding & Elbow Appreciation** â€“ Splints come off and the relief is instant. Everyone tries basic movements again and shares what they missed most- Learn to assess moisture, map flavor profiles, and identify scent notes

### The Concept

The Bound Banquet is about learning what your body does by temporarily losing it. You can't think or control your way through dinner when your arms don't bend. What happens instead is awkward, collaborative, and weirdly freeing. Your elbows become teachers about what's immutable (we all need to eat, we all have joints) and what's malleable (how we care for each other, who gets to feed and be fed).- Earn your official SmelliÃ©r certification
