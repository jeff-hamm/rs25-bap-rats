# The Bound Banquet (Elbow Appreciation)

### Project Overview

We celebrate connection by giving up control. Arms splinted with branches, guests become plant-person hybrids who can't feed themselves. Everything becomes a team effort—an experiment in cooperation, care, and collective awkwardness. Together, we learn that being bound can be surprisingly freeing.

## Experience Journey

1. **Consent** – A brief explanation of the activity and get consent to participate
2. **Splinting** – Participants have their elbows gently bound with branches, locking their arms straight
3. **Activities** – People share a communal meal and play games while splinted. Simple things like passing food or picking up a cup become hilariously difficult, requiring teamwork and creativity
4. **Unbinding & Elbow Appreciation** – Splints come off and the relief is instant. Everyone tries basic movements again and shares what they missed most—scratching an itch, adjusting their hair, or just bending their arm freely

### Thematic Connection

The Bound Banquet is about learning what your body does by temporarily losing it. We splint your elbows straight with branches so you become part plant, part person, and completely dependent on everyone around you.

You can't think or control your way through dinner when your arms don't bend. The Mind would absolutely hate this—all that organizing of "my body does this, your body does that" breaks down the second you need someone else's hands to eat. What happens instead is awkward, collaborative, and weirdly freeing.

Your elbows become teachers about what's immutable (we all need to eat, we all have joints) and what's malleable (how we care for each other, who gets to feed and be fed).

### Project Safety

This involves temporarily binding participants' arms and cooperative feeding, so clear communication, consent, and comfort are central. We have many kinds of splints to accommodate different body types, and everyone is encouraged to participate even if they choose not to be fully splinted. Participants are reminded they can pause or opt out at any time. The experience is designed to be body-positive and inclusive, welcoming all genders, identities, and abilities, while encouraging playful cooperation and shared awkwardness.
