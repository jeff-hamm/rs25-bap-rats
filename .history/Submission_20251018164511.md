# üêÄ RAT Project Onboarding RS25

**DEADLINE FOR PROPOSALS:  10/29**

You may submit proposals for multiple projects. Please specify if you only have the bandwidth for one proposal, all, or some by emailing [devin@take3presents.com](mailto:art@take3presents.com) with your submission.

**Make a copy of this doc ****and use it to prepare and save your answers. We recommend reading through the whole RFP question list at the beginning of your brainstorming process.**

We welcome slide decks or images *in addition to this form *as a way to communicate your project; if you choose to do so, please put all materials into one link.

## Contact Info

Project Leads and Comms Leads are the main liaisons between collaborator crews and Take 3. These are your project reps, and can be the same person. All project-related communication with T3 staff should happen through your project reps. All communications from T3 will be sent to your project reps, who are expected to share relevant information with the rest of their team.

Project Lead Email Address

Project Lead Pronouns

Project Lead Phone Number

Project Lead Full Name

Comms Lead Name [Optional]

**Now, dear Project Lead, it‚Äôs time to be honest with yourself - how good are you at filling out forms and reading emails? **If you‚Äôre not confident, this is your opportunity to designate a Comms Lead to whom we‚Äôll send emails and treat as the primary contact. If you designate a Comms Lead separate from your Project Lead, **please choose someone who is responsive and responsible to represent your team, and brief your crew on these expectations**. If you want information to be shared with your entire crew, consider making a Google-group or other shared email address and adding it here. If you do this, make sure to add art@, alexis@, devin@, and kaizo@take3presents.com to have posting privs to the group. You‚Äôll also have a chance to list other collaborators later on.

## Project Experience Design

Project Name

Organic Chemistry Consulting (Bring a Pheromone)

Your Project Name is your Legacy. Make it short and catchy.

**Provide a brief synopsis of your project.**

Just the elevator pitch to give us a rough sense of the concept. Keep it tight.

The Mind wants to quantify attraction with algorithms. Your microbiome hasn't gotten the memo. Bodies know how to talk to bodies, gut to nose, sweat to brain, flora to flora. Train as a certified Smelli√©r, surrender your scent to the armpit glory hole, and sniff right on chemical connection.

**Describe the participant's journey.**

Provide a play-by-play of what happens from the moment a participant engages in your project to the moment they disengage. Don't include narrative descriptions in this part, keep it pragmatic. A list works well for this. If you have a slide deck or other external link, use the next field.

Participants find a booth with two circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and disembodied human features.  Self-service and staffed sessions available, including during our Pheromone Happy Hour event

Pheromone Matchmaking

* Consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden
* Both smell each other simultaneously
* Each are given a button to indicate if they match.
* Compatible chemistry? Facilitators reveal identities and suggest date activities!
* Incompatible? Anonymity preserved

Scent Smelli√©r Certification

* Hidden participants insert armpits through booth openings and others sample from the outside
* Self-service or guided by facilitator participants learn to:
  * Name the armpit by visible features
  * Assess moisture
  * Map scent impression and flavor profile (earthy, nutty, acidic, floral)
  * Optional taste test and much more!
* Keep your scent journal, gift it to the pit owner, or contribute it to our pheromone files

**Upload Materials/Links**

Sketches, diagrams, presentations, examples, photos, etc.

If you have any additional links to share, please paste them here. Make sure link access is turned on.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CWlh1EqNoOqHqXnsnHrO3pEigTNB3Fhf?usp=sharing

**OPTIONAL: How does your project connect to the moral themes of this event?**

Some questions to consider as you draft your proposal:

* What can you change, and what can‚Äôt you? How do you tell the difference? How do you accept the things you cannot change?
* What is valuable about stability, and what is valuable about novelty? What is problematic about them?
* How do you balance adventure and stability?
* What pieces of ourselves are immutable, and what things are malleable?
* How do you make big decisions? How do you weigh the risks and benefits, and how do you hold space for both the losses and the gains of choosing a path?
* What makes a place home? How do you create a sense of belonging in a new place?

The Mind loves matchmaking algorithms‚Äîcategories, criteria, logical assessments of compatibility. We categorize attraction through appearance and demographics. These feel stable but they're constructed. Chemical communication is older‚Äîit bypasses all that.

Isolating scent from visuals forces a confrontation: which parts of attraction are intrinsic versus learned? People discover chemistry with humans they'd never consider, revealing how malleable their "type" actually was. Journaling creates space to notice signals without immediately sorting them‚Äîembodied awareness instead of overthinking.

We can't change how our microbiomes communicate, but we choose whether to pay attention. Can't control our chemical signatures, but we decide whether to trust or ignore what our bodies know.

**If your project deals with heavy themes, what is your plan for supporting participants through your experience?**

We trust our artists to make compelling, edgy art in safe, inclusive ways. This trust comes with an agreement from us to support you in developing this plan as your project evolves, and an agreement from you to take feedback and adapt your project as needed. Collaborators that do not take this precaution seriously and/or impact participants negatively due to negligence will face consequences. All that said, we are actively seeking art that stretches comfort zones and thoughtfully encourages people to explore the edges of their boundaries.

As you answer this question, please try to consider how people of different backgrounds and identities might experience your project, including but not limited to: BIPOC, working class, queer, trans/gender non-conforming, disabled, and/or people who are part of another marginalized identity.

Be considerate of others and follow the [Art Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1__n_IHIb2oRgfzp9HaLfmvOWPT-98LIVGQlbKJ-X6MM/edit) and [The Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkiZxER73wXF6UFMTx4DwzUHSMo2zFIQ6jZbMMaKtio/edit?usp=sharing). . If you need clarification about an Art Rule and how it might impact your project, reach out to [artsafety@take3presents.com](mailto:artsafety@take3presents.com) with any questions or concerns.  If your art contains sexual content, read the [Sex Art Safety Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBEyn-mp5DGByCDYiD0IkZCxuNShQt0Ph9uL6WCHE48/edit?usp=sharing).

This experience explores attraction through scent and unconventional body engagement, so clear communication, consent, and comfort are central. We provide clear signage explaining what to expect, obtain verbal consent for matchmaking experiences, and remind participants they can pause or opt out anytime. The experience welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities. Self-serve options are available for those who prefer independence, while guided sessions provide structure. Language emphasizes curiosity and appreciation, never judgment. All scents are described using neutral sensory terminology. No requirement to "prepare" armpits‚Äîall natural scents welcome.

**How would you describe the participant experience?**

If your experience falls into more than one of these categories, check the primary purpose. This is not necessarily the mode it will be in most often, but the mode it will inhabit when you‚Äôre activating the room in its fullest form.

* Chill room (for lounging, no performance and low interactivity)
* Passive interactivity (at the viewers own pace)
* Open-ended interactive experience (shticking with active artists, but no set journey)
* Guided experience (they are on a set journey from start to end)
* Dance party (‚Äònuff said)
* Chill Space
* Passive Interactivity
* Open-Ended Interactive
* Guided Experience
* Dance Party

**Structure and/or Room Design**

Describe the physicality of your project briefly. Please include the size. For example:

* ‚ÄúA reskinned 10x10‚Äô EZ-up decorated to look like a small cottage. The interior will be decorated to look like the home of a teddy bear.‚Äù or
* ‚ÄúFloor to ceiling bleachers of wood construction enclosing a space for jello wresting taking up 1/2 of a suite with the other half converted into a lounge."

The booth is a custom-built modular booth constructed from 30" x 30" plywood panels, forming an approximately 5' x 5' enclosed space. The exterior will feature surreal collage-style artwork with orange geometric forms, natural imagery (ferns, flowers, moths), and prominent eye motifs against a black background. The interior creates an intimate sensory environment for exploring pheromonal communication and altered perception.

The room will be sharing space with other art and contain lots of other pheromone references and art

Structure Mock Up

Do you have a sketch, diagram, or map to get a sense of the physicality of your project? This can be from the upload materials above, but please choose something that represents the actual structure (vs. inspirational imagery and interaction design).

## Artist Support (optional)

Take 3 is invested in creating an accessible, safe and supportive community for all. We want to learn more about how to support those who are interested in making work with us. Your answers will help us in this journey, but are not required.

**Do you or any of your crew members identify as BIPOC, working class, queer, trans/gender non-conforming, disabled, and/or part of another marginalized identity?**

We know that the circumstances caused by systemic, historical oppression make it more difficult for some people to participate. To fight against this dynamic, we would like to consider identity as we accept projects and grant resources so we can be more equitable in our distribution of resources. This also helps us gauge the impact of our efforts to shift the diversity of our collaborator pool over time. If you have further questions/feedback on how this information will be used or why we‚Äôre asking for it, please ping art@take3presents.com

**Do you have any suggestions for how we might make our events more inclusive, safe or accessible for people of marginalized identities?**

Your answers will be shared with a small committee of people dedicated to making concrete and actionable recommendations for leadership to consider for this or future events.

**Do you or any of your crew members have access needs that you would like to share with us?**

If so, we would love to hear any suggestions you have for how we can best support you.

**Do you have any ideas for ways we could improve our support for artists?**

We strive for our artists to feel supported in realizing their creative vision AND have a great time before & during the event. Please let us know anything we can do to make this goal a reality. We intend to keep this conversation going throughout the event cycle, and encourage feedback early & often.

**Mentorship Pilot Interest**

Collaborators have requested a mentorship program in which experienced art crews support newer art crews by sharing advice, answering questions and being general buds. This experimental program is completely optional, and we will certainly be working out the kinks as we try it out, but please let us know if you want to opt in!

*Priority is given to CATs but if we have available mentors for RATs we will pair you.*
