# [PROJECT NAME TBD] - REVISED FINAL VERSION

## Room Service 2025 RAT Submission

## SECTION 2 - Experience Design

### Project Name (50 char max)

**[TO BE DETERMINED]**
*(See suggestions below)*

---

### Brief Synopsis (300 char max)

The Mind wants to quantify attraction with algorithms. Your microbiome hasn't gotten the memo. Bodies know how to talk to bodies, gut to nose, sweat to brain, flora to flora. Train as a certified Smelliér, surrender your scent to the armpit glory hole, and sniff right on chemical connection. 

---

### Describe the Participant's Journey (1000 char max)

Participants find a booth with two circular apertures framed by branches, vines, and disembodied human features.  Self-service and staffed sessions available, including during our Pheromone Happy Hour event

Pheromone Matchmaking

* Consenting participants insert armpits from opposite sides, remaining hidden
* Both smell each other simultaneously
* Each are given a button to indicate if they match.
* Compatible chemistry? Facilitators reveal identities and suggest date activities!* Incompatible? Anonymity preserved

Scent Smelliér Certification

* Hidden participants insert armpits through booth openings and others sample from the other side
* Via self-service or guided by a facilitator, participants learn to:
  * Name the armpit by visible features
  * Assess moisture
  * Map scent impression and flavor profile (earthy, nutty, acidic, floral)
  * Optional taste test and much more!
* Keep your scent journal, gift it to the pit owner, or contribute it to our pheromone files

### How Does Your Project Connect to the Moral Themes? (1000 char max)

The Mind loves matchmaking algorithms—categories, criteria, logical assessments of compatibility. We categorize attraction through appearance and demographics. These feel stable but they're constructed. Chemical communication is older—it bypasses all that.

Isolating scent from visuals forces a confrontation: which parts of attraction are intrinsic versus learned? People discover chemistry with humans they'd never consider, revealing how malleable their "type" actually was. Journaling creates space to notice signals without immediately sorting them—embodied awareness instead of overthinking.

We can't change how our microbiomes communicate, but we choose whether to pay attention. Can't control our chemical signatures, but we decide whether to trust or ignore what our bodies know.

### Supporting Participants with Challenging Experiences (1500 char max)

This experience explores attraction through scent and unconventional body engagement, so clear communication, consent, and comfort are central. We provide clear signage explaining what to expect, obtain verbal consent for matchmaking experiences, and remind participants they can pause or opt out anytime. The experience welcomes all bodies, genders, identities, and abilities. Self-serve options are available for those who prefer independence, while guided sessions provide structure. Language emphasizes curiosity and appreciation, never judgment. All scents are described using neutral sensory terminology. No requirement to "prepare" armpits—all natural scents welcome.

### Structure / Room Design

A botanical surrealist installation featuring a wooden booth adorned with branches, vines, and disembodied human features (lips, eyes). Two circular apertures serve as broadcast/receiving stations—armpit glory holes enabling scent-based communication between participants on opposite sides while remaining visually separated. The organic aesthetic evokes the microbiome's intelligence: flora and fauna intertwined, the body's ecosystem speaking in chemical signals, leafy tendrils connecting what The Mind kept separate.

**Dimensions:** Approximately 50" wide × 24" deep
**Footprint:** 8-10 feet total including queue/observation area and journaling station
**Aesthetic:** Botanical surrealism with disembodied human features—aligns perfectly with Room Service 2025 style guide
**Symbolism:** The microbiome's broadcast network made visible through living, breathing botanical elements

---

### Placement Preferences

1. Art Room (regular or suite)
2. "Quiet" Floor room
3. Rotunda

**Rationale:** Running Elbow Appreciation concurrently in Art Room. Both projects invite participants to notice and celebrate unconventional body parts with curiosity rather than The Mind's usual judgment. Shared crew and scheduling. The contemplative practice of journaling scent observations and trusting bodily chemistry benefits from a semi-private space for reflection.

---

### When Active

- Self-serve broadcasting: 2pm-1am Thu-Sun
- Staffed certification/matchmaking: Variable, confirmed Saturday afternoon/evening

## CORE CONCEPT

**The Mind vs. The Microbiome:**
The Mind thinks it knows who we should be attracted to—it has categories, criteria, logical frameworks. But the microbiome has been broadcasting all along: pheromones, chemical signals, flora-to-flora communication that bypasses thought entirely.

**The Freedom of Paying Attention:**
There's profound emotional liberation in documenting what our bodies notice. When we journal scent profiles, map flavor notes, pay attention to chemistry without The Mind's usual categorization, we practice trusting our embodied wisdom. We learn our gut (literally) might be a better matchmaker than our logic.

**Botanical Intelligence:**
Like the leafy tendrils spreading through The Body in the event narrative, the microbiome connects parts The Mind kept separate. It enables communication through living systems—flora, fauna, bacteria—that know more about connection than any algorithm The Mind could build.

**The Practice:**
Through sommelier training and scent journaling, participants learn to read broadcasts they usually ignore. This isn't rebellion against The Mind—it's an invitation to notice what's already there. To pay attention. To trust what your sweat glands and gut flora have been trying to tell you all along.

The Mind categorizes. The microbiome connects. The journal captures what happens when you listen.
