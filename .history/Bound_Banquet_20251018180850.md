# The Bound Banquet (Elbow Appreciation)

### Project Overview

We celebrate connection by giving up control. Arms splinted with branches, guests become plant-person hybrids who can't feed themselves. Everything becomes a team effort—an experiment in cooperation, care, and collective awkwardness. Together, we learn that being bound can be surprisingly freeing.

## Experience Journey

1. **Consent** – A brief explanation of the activity and get consent to participate
2. **Splinting** – Participants have their elbows gently bound with branches, locking their arms straight
3. **Activities** – People share a communal meal and play games while splinted. Simple things like passing food or picking up a cup become hilariously difficult, requiring teamwork and creativity
4. **Unbinding & Elbow Appreciation** – Splints come off and the relief is instant. Everyone tries basic movements again and shares what they missed most—scratching an itch, adjusting their hair, or just bending their arm freely

### Thematic Connection

The Bound Banquet is about learning what your body does by temporarily losing it. We splint your elbows straight with branches so you become part plant, part person, and completely dependent on everyone around you.

You can't think or control your way through dinner when your arms don't bend. The Mind would absolutely hate this—all that organizing of "my body does this, your body does that" breaks down the second you need someone else's hands to eat. What happens instead is awkward, collaborative, and weirdly freeing.

Your elbows become teachers about what's immutable (we all need to eat, we all have joints) and what's malleable (how we care for each other, who gets to feed and be fed).

### Project Safety

This involves temporarily binding participants' arms and cooperative feeding, so clear communication, consent, and comfort are central. We have many kinds of splints to accommodate different body types, and everyone is encouraged to participate even if they choose not to be fully splinted. Participants are reminded they can pause or opt out at any time. The experience is designed to be body-positive and inclusive, welcoming all genders, identities, and abilities, while encouraging playful cooperation and shared awkwardness.

### Safety Considerations

#### Restraints

We will be hosting this event in our art room on Saturday evening. When guests arrive, the structure of the event will be explained clearly making sure everyone gives consent.

* The full Bound Banquet experience involves attaching dowels, branches or decorations to both of a participant’s arms with comfortable cloth wrapping, preventing them from bending their elbows to the degree of their choosing.
* Everyone is encouraged to participate even if they choose not to be fully splinted.
* We have many kinds of splints to accommodate different body types.
* Participants are reminded they can pause or opt out at any time.
* The experience is designed to be body-positive and inclusive, welcoming all genders, identities, and abilities, while encouraging playful cooperation and shared awkwardness.

Rules and guidelines will also be posted on signs throughout the room.

#### Food

We will be providing some of the food for the meal, but guests are also invited to bring shared dishes as long as they follow our food safety guidelines:

##### Storage & Temperature Control

* We do not plan to bring significant perishable food. However, Our team is staying in a suite with a refrigerator and kitchenette. All perishable food being served by us will be kept refrigerated before the event.
* Guests bringing food will be instructed that, if their dish requires refrigeration and they don't have access to their own fridge, they must:

  * Bring non-perishable food, or
  * Reach out to us ahead of time so we can arrange fridge space for their item.
* Any perishable food that cannot be kept refrigerated after the meal will be discarded.

###### Hygiene and Handling

* All participants handling food will wash hands thoroughly.
* We don’t plan significant food prep, however, Clean utensils and cutting surfaces will be used for all food preparation.
* All food being served will be clearly labeled with allergen information (e.g., nuts, dairy, gluten).
* Labels will be provided, all guests will be instructed to clearly label any food with allergen information
* The point of this activity is that during the meal, participants can only feed each other rather than feed themselves.To ensure this is done safely:

  * We will provide disposable cutlery with clearly labeled containers for “unused” and “used” utensils to prevent cross-contamination.
  * If you switch from feeding one person to another, you must discard your used utensil and take a new one.
  * These rules will be posted on signs at the table and conveyed verbally to each guest upon arrival.
* Hand sanitizer will be available and must be used before anyone handles food or utensils.
* Our team will supervise shared dishes to ensure nothing is tampered with.

###### Additional Safety Measures

* Only human participants will be fed—no food will be shared with animals.

No dosed or infused foods of any kind will be served, and this rule will be made clear to guests verbally and through signage.**
